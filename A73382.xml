            <title>The portraiture of the image of God in man In his three estates, of creation. Restauration. Glorification. Digested into two parts. The first containing, the image of God both in the body and soule of man, and immortality of both: with a description of the severall members of the body, and the two principall faculties of the soule, the understanding and the will; in which consisteth his knowledge, and liberty of his will. The second containing, the passions of man in the concupiscible and irascible part of the soule: his dominion ouer the creatures; also a description of his active and contemplative life; with his conjunct or married estate. Whereunto is annexed an explication of sundry naturall and morall observations for the clearing of divers Scriptures. All set downe by way of collation, and cleared by sundry distinctions, both out of the schoolemen, and moderne writers. The third edition, corrected and enlarged. By I. Weemse, of Lathocker in Scotland, preacher of Christs Gospel.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here were two pillars before <hi>Salomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<note place="margin">1 King. 7.21. 2 Chron. 3.17.</note> (right worthy Sir) <hi>Jachin,</hi> that is, <hi>God will eſtabliſh;</hi> and <hi>Bohaz,</hi> that is, <hi>ſtrength.</hi> Theſe two pillars were ſet up, to uphold the porch of the Temple. So there are two pillars, which uphold the Church, and this world, <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Juſtice:</hi> true <hi>Religion</hi> upholds the Church, and <hi>Iuſtice</hi> the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Of theſe two, <hi>religion</hi> ſtands upon the right hand to uphold, (as <hi>Jachin</hi> did,) and <hi>Juſtice</hi> upon the left hand (as <hi>Bohaz</hi> did.) <hi>Religion</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:173315:3"/>hath the firſt place, and therefore the Iewes ſay well, that it is for <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> cauſe the world ſtands; that is, the <hi>Church.</hi> All the tents were pitched about the Tabernacle; to teach us,
<note place="margin">Numb. 2.</note> that the world is but an Inne for the Church to lodge in for a while; and if the Saints were once gathered out of the world, the foure corners of the earth would ſo one clap together,

               <hi>and the Heavens ſhould goe away with a noyſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The pillar which upholds the world upon the left hand is <hi>Justice;
<note place="margin">Prov. 16.12.</note> it upholds the earth, and the Kings throne.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>Habak.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Iam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluit Lex; the Law failes:</hi> This is a ſpeech bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the pulſe of a man; for as we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the eſtate of a man by his pulſe; if it ſtirre not at all, then we know he is dead, if it ſtirre violently, then we take him to be in a Feaver; if it keepe an equall ſtroke, then wee know he is ſound and hole. The pulſe of the Common-wealth is <hi>Juſtice.</hi> If <hi>Juſtice</hi> bee violent and turned into wormewood, then the Common-wealth is in a bad eſtate; if it ſtirre not at all, then the Common-wealth is dead, and if it have an equall ſtroke, then it is ſound and hole.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, theſe two pillars, <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi>

But no man can enter into his mothers wombe againe: This principle is wrong applyed by him in Divinity, for wee are borne againe as Chriſt teacheth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3, <hi>by the water and the Spirit;</hi> and not by entring into our mothers wombe againe. This vaine exceſſe of reaſon and fleſhly wiſedom, is that which the Apoſtle condemnes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19.</p>
            <p>Againe, when by <hi>naturall reaſon</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> we take up a thing; and by <hi>faith</hi> wee beleeve the ſelfe ſame thing, if <hi>reaſon</hi> claime the firſt place here, then ſhe is not a dutifull hand-maid.</p>
            <p>There are ſome things in Divinity which are <hi>mixtly divine:</hi> there are other things <hi>meerely divine:</hi> theſe things which are <hi>mixtly divine,</hi> in ſuch reaſon may ſerve but onely in the ſecond place; <hi>primo creduntur, &amp; poſtea intelliguntur:</hi> as a man beleeves the immortality of the ſoule: then he begins to take up the ſame by <hi>reaſon;</hi> muſt reaſon here advance her ſelfe as farre as faith? or muſt <hi>reaſon</hi> come here before faith? God forbid: for that which I beleeve, I beleeve it, <hi>ex authoritate dicentis,</hi> relying upon the truth of him that ſaith it, and al the evidence which I get by <hi>reaſon</hi> is nothing to this certitude: if <hi>reaſon</hi> ſhould goe before like an uſher to make way to <hi>faith,</hi> we ſhould never beleeve. The <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> ſay well, <hi>Rationes praecedentes minuunt fidem; ſed rationes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentes augent fidem</hi> Reaſons going before faith weaken faith, but reaſons comming after faith ſtrengthen it: <hi>reaſon</hi> makes not the matter more ſure, <hi>ex parte veritatis dictantis, ſed ex parte intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectus aſſentientis:</hi> in reſpect of God the ſpeaker, but in reſpect of the weakeneſſe of our underſtanding, for by this acceſſe of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:173315:6"/>knowledge it is more canfirmed. A gardiner when hee is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to plant a tree, firſt hee digs the earth and makes an empty roome in the boſom thereof for the planting of the tree: then after he takes the ſame earth (which if it had not beene digged up, had ſtayed the planting of the tree) and caſts it about the roote of the tree againe, for the faſtning of it: hee takes alſo the ſtones which he had digged up with the earth, and kills the mole which would have beene hurtfull to the tree: ſo, firſt the Lord empties our ſoule of all <hi>naturall reaſon;</hi> and this heavenly gardiner makes a roome, wherein hee plants this ſupernaturall grace of <hi>faith</hi> by his owne hand; but when he hath planted this heavenly plant faith in the ſoule, <hi>reaſon</hi> will ſerve for two uſes; firſt, for the confirmation and eſtabliſhing of our <hi>faith</hi> new planted: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for killing of all contrary hereſies beſides which might hurt our faith: But in things which are meerely divine, <hi>&amp; quae cadunt directè ſub fide,</hi> and fall directly under faith, as the myſterie of the Trinitie and the incarnation; what can <hi>reaſon</hi> or <hi>Philoſophy</hi> doe here; but admire theſe hid myſteries which ſhe can never reach unto? if <hi>reaſon</hi> the hand-maid have alwaies her eyes towards her miſtreſſe, then we may make good uſe of her in the Church.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vine-tree</hi> of it ſelfe bringeth forth the moſt comfortable grape for our nouriſhment, and chearing of our hearts; but yet if we ſet a <hi>Mandrake</hi> by it, and then drinke of that wine, that wine will make us ſleepe the better. The knowledg of Divinity is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comfortable knowledg, but yet <hi>Philoſophy</hi> as the <hi>Mandrak</hi> being ſet by it, may have the profitable uſe alſo. Schoole divinity hath moſt incroched upon the truth and obſcured it; framing all religion according to the platforme of Philoſophie. There was one <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> a Schoolemaſter in <hi>Athens</hi> having crooked feete, hee had his ſhooes made according to his feere: one ſtole his ſhooes from him; but he wiſh: that the feete of thoſe who had ſtole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſhooes, might become like unto the ſhooes. This was a fooliſh wiſh to deſire the ſtraight foot, to be made conforme to the crooked ſhooe, whereas the ſhooe ſhould be made conforme to the ſtraight foote. What is <hi>Schoole divinity,</hi> but a crooked ſhooe? therfore to conforme <hi>divinity</hi> to it, where to conforme the ſtraight foot to the crooked ſhooe. <hi>Divinity</hi> muſt be the ſquare to correct that which is not ſtraight.</p>
            <p>Although this ſchoole divinity hath beene mightily abuſed, yet the abuſe takes not away the uſe. For the right uſing of the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men wee muſt remember, that there is a threefold judgement,
<pb facs="tcp:173315:7"/>1. the judgement of <hi>verity,</hi> the ſecond is the judgement of <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,</hi> the third is the judgement of <hi>charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The judgement of <hi>verity</hi> is onely to be found in the Scriptures, and all other writings ſhould bee tryed by them, as the canon and touchſtone: but the church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have the Scriptures to be tryed by the Fathers and Schoolemen.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the judgement of <hi>prudencie</hi> is requiſite in reading of them; men ſhould not dote upon them: for this is generally the fault of moſt of them, that yee ſhall finde little pietie or matter of holineſſe in all their writings. <hi>Bucer</hi> ſaid well, that there is more holineſſe to be found in Seneca than in moſt of them: if men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe too much with them, they ſhall finde but little ſanctification by them, but having their mindes inlightened by the holy Scrp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and their affections ſanctified, they may make uſe of them Some of them we may reade diſtinctly and judiciouſly; ſome of them we are to reade curſorily; and ſome of them we are but to looke upon here and there: ſome meates we cut firſt, then we chew them, then we digeſt them; other meates we ſwallow them; and other meates wee taſte onely of them. So wee ſhould uſe theſe Schoolemen: ſome of them we ſhould reade diſtinctly: others of them we ſhould ſwallow as it were, and run over lightly and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them wee ſhould taſt and looke but upon them here and there.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>prudency</hi> ſhould teach us, what wee ſhould obſerve as impertinent in them, and what to reject; their queſtions for the moſt part are idle and curious, as the moſt of their hypotheticall propoſitions, and the manner of their diſputations; for other times they diſpute <hi>ex alienis principijs,</hi> out of the grounds of other ſciences: they confound <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy:</hi> and the <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> which they uſe oftentimes are impertinent. They bring innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable arguments and diſputations oftentimes probable on both ſides, and they truſt too much to the teſtimonie of men; they goe very raſhly many of them, and ſpeake not ſoberly enough of the great myſtery of the Trinity, and Incarnation; bringing in philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophicall reaſons: whereas theſe myſteries ſhould rather be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red than ſearched after: and herein <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſayd well, <hi>Eti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>And laſt of al, they diſtinguiſh where the law diſtinguiſheth not.</p>
            <p>The third judgement is the judgement of <hi>charity;</hi> when wee reade them and finde many groſſe errours in them; wee are not
<pb facs="tcp:173315:7"/>for that to reject them, for we ſhall finde ſometimes points nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well cleared in them. The Iewes have a proverbe, <hi>Comede dactylos, &amp; projice foras duritiem; Eate the Date, and caſt away the stone;</hi> ſo ſhould wee in reading of them, take that which is good, and caſt away their errours. The <hi>Toade,</hi> although it bee a loathſome creature, yet we will take a ſtone out of the head of it, and uſe it: the <hi>Muske-kat</hi> is an il-favoured creature and yet we will take the muske of it to perfume things with: The <hi>Raven</hi> was an uncleane creature under the Law, yet <hi>Elias</hi> was fed by it: ſo wee may get many profitable helpes by theſe Schoolemen, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have great errours: but we muſt take heed, that we fawningly flatter them not.</p>
            <p>The flatterers of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> were ſo groſſe, that they would licke up the ſpittle of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> proteſting that it was ſweeter than <hi>nectar;</hi> we muſt not ſo doate upon them, as to licke up their excrements, but onely follow them in ſo farre as they follow Chriſt. We muſt not give to them glorious titles, for then as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, We muſt give titles to men, as <hi>Jacobus de Voragine,</hi> as though he had eaten up the whole Booke of God in reading it; and to <hi>Thomas Aquinas, they gave the name doctor Seraphicus &amp; angelicus:</hi> to <hi>Scotus, doctor ſubtilis;</hi> to <hi>Durandus, doctor irrefragabilis;</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>venerabilis incoeptor;</hi> to another, <hi>doctor fundatiſsimus;</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>illuminatus;</hi> to another, <hi>doctor reſolutus:</hi> and a thouſand ſuch.</p>
            <p>Among the Iewes, when the holy Ghoſt was not revealed unto them, then they tooke glorious titles upon them, as one was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Wee ſhould in charity judge their errors, for they lived in the houre of darkeneſſe, and few theſe were then to oppoſe againſt them, and what marvaile if they did oftentimes ſtumble; ſo that this was but infirmity in them, and not malice.</p>
            <p>But if they could now behold from heaven the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (who brags that ſhee ſucceeds to them) with her new plots, as her
<pb facs="tcp:173315:8"/>
               <hi>equivocations, mentall reſervations,</hi> allowing the <hi>killing of Princes, abſolving ſubjects from loyaltie</hi> towards their Prince; wives from their husbands, children from their parents; and giving to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges not onely <hi>cultum reſpectivum,</hi> which the ſchoolemen gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, but alſo <hi>cultum conjunctum,</hi> or <hi>coadoration;</hi> would they not bee aſhamed of theſe their children, and bluſh if they could behold them?</p>
            <p>A Cardinall upon a time cauſed a Painter to paint the twelve Apoſtles; the Painter painted them looking ſomewhat reddiſh; the Cardinall asked the Painter whether the Apoſtles looked ſo when they were here alive? no ſaid the Painter: why doſt thou then ſo paint them ſaid the Cardinall? the Painter replyed, They bluſh ſo now when they behold the corruptions of you who take upon you to bee leaders of the Church. If the Schoolemen could behold the groſſe and innumerable corruptions which are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained now in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which were not then, would they not bluſh and be aſhamed, and diſclaime them for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?</p>
            <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> was upon the mount, hee brought a patterne of the whole frame of the tabernacle from the Lord, and erected it according to the patterne received, but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath erected another patterne, framing religion by the mould of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon.</p>
            <p>If ye will take a view of ſeverall points profeſſed in Poperie, ye may eaſily perceive whence they have taken the patterne of them, not from <hi>Moſes</hi> on the mount, but from ſcholaſticke ſpeculations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe the Mathematickes conſider lines, figures, circles, points, abſtracted from bodies, therefore they gather, that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents may be in the Sacrament without the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe morall Phyloſophy eſtabliſheth neyther pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment nor reward, unleſſe the free will of man goe before; hence they inferre, that there is free will in man: againe, becauſe morall Philoſophy knoweth no vertues, but inherent habites and vertues; therefore it is that they ſet themſelves ſo againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſſe of Chriſt: the morall Philoſopher cals vice a voluntary evill, therefore they inferre, that concupiſcence is not ſin, becauſe it is not altogether voluntary.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, from the Politickes, in policie, the beſt ſort of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is monarchicall, therefore the Popes government muſt bee monarchicall. Againe, in Princes Courts, men uſe mediators to
<pb facs="tcp:173315:8"/>goe to their Prince, therefore they conclude, that we muſt uſe the interceſſion of the Saints to God. In policie, no lawes are given, but which the ſubjects may fulfill, therefore man is able to fulfill the law of God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, from the Phyſickes; Phyſicke teacheth us that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy turnes to corruption, and diſſolves; upon this they inferre, that man before his fall his body ſhould have dyed naturally, as it doth, if ſupernaturall righteouſneſſe had not kept backe corruption; ſo that they make God as well the author of death; as well as of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conſidering man here onely after the principles of nature, and not according to his firſt creation. Againe, Phyſicke teacheth us, that the blood alwaies followeth the body, therefore they have taken away the cup from the people in the Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſay they) if they get his fleſh, they get his blood, <hi>per conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitantiam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, the Metaphyſickes teach us, that every poſitive thing is good, therefore they define originall ſinne to be a meere privation.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, the Platonickes were mightily deluded by the appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſpirits, hence they have borrowed their apparition of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, from the Poets fables they have taken their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</p>
            <p>Laſt, from the incantations of the Gentiles, they have borrowed their exorciſmes. Thus wee ſee that they have not taken their platforme from above in the mount with <hi>Moſes,</hi> but from below, from humane reaſon and Philoſophie: and here they ought to have remembred that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Take heede that no man ſpoile you with Philoſophie.</hi> Curteous Reader, if there bee any thing here that may ſerve for the good of the Church and your edification, give the glory to God, and reape you the fruits: if there bee any thing that ſeemeth not correſpondent to reaſon or the word of God, reprove me for it, and it ſhall be like a pretious balme unto my head.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:173315:22"/>be the head and not the tayle.</hi> So Chriſt is called the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.23. and the husband is called, <hi>the head of the wife,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. So the excellenteſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are called, <hi>the head of ſpices, Exod.</hi> 30.25.</p>
                     <p>All the ſenſes are placed in the <hi>Head,</hi> except the touch, which is ſpread thorow the whole body. Secondly, the <hi>Head</hi> is ſupereminent above the reſt of the body. Thirdly, the <hi>Head</hi> giveth influence to the reſt of body. Fourthly, there is a conformitie betwixt the <hi>Head</hi> and the reſt of the body. Chriſt, the <hi>Head</hi> of his Church, he hath graces above the reſt of his members; he giveth influence and grace to them, and hee is like to them.

Fourthly, there are five tunicles in the <hi>Eye</hi> to keepe it from any hurt; the firſt is called <hi>araneae tunica,</hi> like a ſpiders webbe; the ſecond, <hi>retiformis,</hi> woven like a net: the third, <hi>uvea,</hi> like a berry: the fourth, <hi>Cornea,</hi> like horne: the fift, <hi>adnata tunica,</hi> the cover of the eye, or the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids. <hi>David</hi> to expreſſe the ſpeciall care that God hath over his Saints, ſaith, <hi>Thou keepest me as the apple of thine eye, Pſal.</hi> 17.8. That is, thou haſt a ſpeciall care over me, thou guardeſt me many wayes, as the apple of the <hi>Eye</hi> is guarded with theſe five tunicles.

               <p>When wee put water into wine, at the firſt the wine converts the water into it; but put often water to it, then all turnes to water.

It is true, there was ſome contrariety here; for otherwaies hee could not have beene nouriſhed, but this was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the hurt of the whole, which remained whole and perfit; ſo that his body ſhould have beene <hi>aequiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenter incorruptibile, licet non videretur eadem numero materia.</hi> It ſhould ſtill have remained that ſelfe-ſame body, although in it there was ſome alteration: for even as <hi>Theſeus</hi> Shippe, (after that he had ſcoured the Sea from Pirats by her) they hung her up as a memoriall to the poſterity; and the <hi>Athenians,</hi>

<note place="margin">The tenet of the Church of Rome, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the immortality of the body.</note> that the body of man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall was mortall of it ſelfe, and that the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of it, came onely from without, from that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall righteouſneſſe which God cloathed <hi>Adam</hi> with, and that death is onely but by accident from ſinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it removeth the bridle, <hi>originall righteouſneſſe,</hi> which held backe death: and (they ſay) that the ſoule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

               <p>Againe, they hold, that this neceſſity of death which was in nature before the fall, is now turned ſince the fall into a puniſhment of ſinne. It was naturall before the fall (ſay they) for a woman to beare children, but after the fall it was painefull, and a puniſhment of ſinne. It was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall before the fall for the Serpent to glide upon her belly, but after the fall, ſhe was to glide with paine upon her belly, this was the puniſhment of ſin. So (ſay they) death was naturall to man before the fall in his <hi>Pure natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> but now it is turned to him unto puniſhment of ſinne; and as the beaſts which ſinne not, yet die; ſo ſhould man in his <hi>Pure naturals,</hi> have died, although he had not ſinned, if ſupernaturall righteouſnes had not reſtrained his death.

The ſoule (ſaith hee) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied in her naturall deſires, in her vegetative and ſenſitive faculties, cannot long for thoſe againe, by a ſupernaturall deſire; for it longeth now, <hi>to be like the Angels of God; neither marrying, nor giving in marriage, Matth.</hi> 22.30. But ſupernaturally in the eſtate of bleſſedneſſe ſhee deſireth ſuch a body, which ſhall not hinder the body to attaine to her ſupreme and laſt end. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is true, that after the fall, the vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ſenſitive faculties hinder the intellectuall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie to attaine to the ſupreme end, God; but before the fall, and in the conjunction of the ſoule with the body againe, theſe inferiour faculties were ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and ſhall be ſubordinate to the ſuperior facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and did no wayes, hinder or ſhall hinder the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior facultie; therefore the ſoule naturally before the fall deſired, according to all thoſe faculties, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the body, and ſo it ſhall in the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

When a man looketh upon a horſe, hee ſeeth him of ſuch quantitie, of ſuch a colour, and in ſuch a place; but when hee is conceived in the minde, then it is an univerſall notion agreeing to all horſes. As the thing conceived in the minde is not viſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath no colours, it is not audible, becauſe it hath no ſound, it hath no quantitie, as bigge or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: So the ſoule it ſelfe muſt be of this nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all theſe; quantity, quality, time, and place; and therefore cannot be corruptible.</p>
               <p>If the Soule were mortall, then it ſhould follow,

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tribus modis pervenitur ad cognitionem Dei.</hi> 1. <hi>per viam negationis.</hi>
                  </note> the Scriptures proceede thus in diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing God, as, <hi>God cannot denie himſelfe,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. <hi>God dwels not in houſes made with hands, Act.</hi> 17. <hi>God neither ſleepes nor ſlumbers, Pſa.</hi> 121.4. Here we proceede as the carver of an image doth, he cuts off this and this, to make it thus: and for this purpoſe they apply that of <hi>Seneca, Deus est id quod vides, &amp; quod uon vides; God is that which thou ſeeſt, and which thou ſeeſt not;</hi> by affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation we know what a thing is, and how it is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from other things; but when we proceed by way of deniall, we diſtinguiſh a thing from other things, but know not what it is. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſheweth this way of negation very excellently; <hi>Circumſpicit anima mea, &amp; non videt pulchritudinem tuam; auſcultat &amp; non audit harmoniam tuam; olfacit &amp; non percipit ordorem tuum, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pat &amp; non ſentit levitatem tuam, habes enim haec in te do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Deus, modo ineffabili:</hi> that is, <hi>My ſoule looketh round about and ſeeth not thy beauty, it hearkneth, and heares not thy harmony, it ſmels but ſmels not thy ſavour, it ſeeles but feeles not thy lightneſſe, for thou haſt theſe things in thee O Lord after an inſpeakeable manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here wee muſt marke that wee muſt not ſtill proceede in deniall, for then our mindes would evaniſh to nothing; but at laſt wee muſt reſt in ſome poſitive thing, which carrieth ſome reſemblance of God; he is not a body, becauſe a body is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, hee is not like to other Spirits mutable: but
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:173315:51"/>a Spirit immutable, moſt ſimple, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

               <p>Secondly, we proceed, <hi>per viam eminentiae,</hi> good and evill are ſaid to be comparatively with that which is beſt; amongſt the creatures a Body is good, a Spirit is better, which notwithſtanding hath not his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of himſelfe; therefore hee muſt have it of him, who is abſolutely good; The Scriptures teach us how to take up God thus, the excellent things, it calles them Gods things or belonging to God; as high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines it calls them <hi>Gods mountaines, Num.</hi> 10.33. tall Cedars it calles them, <hi>Gods Cedars, Pſal.</hi> 80.11. great wreſtlings it calls them <hi>Gods wreſtlings, Gen.</hi> 30.8. So it is ſaid, <hi>Ninive was great to God,</hi> that is, very great. <hi>Ionas</hi> 3.3. So, <hi>Moſes was faire to God;</hi> that is, very faire, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.20. So when the Scripture will expreſſe great things, it compounds them with the name of God, <hi>Iah,</hi> ſo with the name of God, <hi>El,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.20. <hi>Arriel,</hi> that is, as yee would ſay, <hi>A very ſtrong Lyon,</hi> to teach us that when we ſee any excellent thing in the creatures, wee ſhould elevate our mindes to the infinite beauty and greatneſſe which is in God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.10. therefore <hi>Iacob</hi> when hee ſaw <hi>Eſaus</hi> loving countenance, it was as though he had ſeene the face of God.

                  </note> we proceede to take up God, <hi>Per viam cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſationis,</hi> from the effects to take up the cauſe; as firſt, to that firſt matter, which the Philoſophers call <hi>Materia prima,</hi> or that <hi>Tohu vabohu,</hi> voide of all forme, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.

There is a twofold glaſſe by the which we know God; the firſt, is the Scriptures; the ſecond, is the booke of nature; but by both theſe we get but an obſcure ſort of knowledge of God; and as in an enigmaticall or darke ſpeech we apprehend certaine ſignes, but wee come not to the full meaning of the things ſignified, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> propoſed to the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> this Riddle, <hi>Out of the eater came meate, and out of the bitter came ſweet, Iudg.</hi> 14.15.

A man when hee beholds a Fiſh in the water, he ſeeth her by two middles.

               <p>Firſt, the powers of the Soule which are diſperſed in the organs of the Body, (in the Eye it is ſeeing, in the Eare it is hearing,) yet in the Soule it ſelfe they are united, <hi>purè &amp; eminenter,</hi> ſimply and eminently.

               <p>Man before his fall could not take up that fully,

               <p>THere are two <hi>principall faculties</hi> in the ſoule; the <hi>underſtanding</hi> and the will, which continually accompany it, both in the body, and out of the body.</p>
               <p>The underſtanding,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Prop. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>is an eſſentiall facultie in the Soule, whereby it knoweth, judgeth, and diſcerneth naturally truth from falſehood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The will,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Illuſt. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>is an eſſentiall facultie in the Soule working freely, having liberty to chuſe, refuſe, or ſuſpend, not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate to one thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is called a <hi>facultie,</hi> and not a <hi>habite;</hi> becauſe a <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite</hi> is determinate to one thing; but a <hi>facultie</hi> may make choyce of moe. Secondly it is ſaid; <hi>to worke freely,</hi> to put a difference betwixt it and naturall agents, which ſtill worke after the ſame manner, and are alwaies car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the ſame object: as the Sunne naturally cannot but heate, and it is but by accident if it breede cold: againe, it is ſaid, <hi>to worke freely,</hi> to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene it and the actions of the beaſts, which are but <hi>ſemiliberae actiones,</hi> for the beaſts cannot but chuſe ſtill the ſelfe ſame thing, being alike affected; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hungry they cannot chuſe but eate, as the ſtone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heavy cannot but goe to the center. Creatures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life, have neither <hi>liberum motum,</hi> a free motion, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are moved by another) neither have they <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum judicium,</hi> free judgement, becauſe they are not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by reaſon:
<note place="margin">Agens naturale move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ad finem, agens per intellectum movetur in finem.</note> the beaſts have a <hi>free motion,</hi> becauſe they move themſelves, according to the natural inſtinct which God hath indued them with; but they have not a <hi>free judgement,</hi> for they are not directed by reaſon. Man hath
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:173315:63"/>both <hi>free motion,</hi> and <hi>free judgement;</hi> whereby he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>freely. Naturall agents</hi> determinate no end to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but reaſonable creatures propound and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate an end to themſelves: therefore no <hi>naturall agent</hi> hath <hi>freedome,</hi> but <hi>inſtinct.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are three properties of the <hi>Will.</hi> Firſt,
<note place="margin">Tres Proprietates volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, conformitas, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas &amp; poteſtas.</note> the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> of the <hi>will</hi> with the <hi>underſtanding.</hi> Secondly, the <hi>liberty</hi> of the <hi>will;</hi> for when it followeth the <hi>last judgement</hi> of the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> it followes it freely. Thirdly, the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>will,</hi> whereby the <hi>will</hi> after the election, (which now it hath gotten by the direction of the <hi>underſtanding</hi>) applieth it ſelfe to the attaining of the object.</p>
               <p>The firſt property of the <hi>will</hi> is,
<note place="margin">The firſt property of the will.</note> that in the operation it dependeth upon the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and followeth the direction of the mind.</p>
               <p>The <hi>will</hi> followes the direction of the <hi>underſtanding,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There is in the <hi>underſtanding, intellection,</hi>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:173315:64"/>
                  <hi>this may be done;</hi> and another following the <hi>practicall underſtanding,</hi> ſaying, <hi>this ſhall be done;</hi> and this <hi>laſt judgement,</hi> of <hi>practicall underſtanding,</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and ſaith, <hi>this will I doe,</hi> ſhe is in ſuſpence before ſhee heare this laſt concluſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is the reaſon that the <hi>will</hi> doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way follow the laſt <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>underſtanding?</hi> for oftentimes it goeth a plaine contrary courſe in that which the underſtanding hath diſcerned, as <hi>Medea</hi> ſaid, <hi>Video meliora proboque, deteriora ſequor; I ſee the good, but I follow the bad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ground of this proceeds from the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding:</hi> for the <hi>underſtanding</hi> having diſcerned a thing to be good, the <hi>affections</hi> draw the minde to a new reſolution, as wee ſee in that complaint of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>The good that I would doe, that I doe not; and the evill that I would not doe, that I doe;</hi> but ſtill the <hi>Will</hi> followeth the <hi>laſt reſolution</hi> of the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;</hi> otherwiſe of it ſelfe it is but <hi>caecapoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>underſtanding</hi> hath a mutuall dependance from the <hi>Will,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Prop. </seg>
                  </label> and is ſet on worke by it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Will,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Illuſt. </seg>
                  </label> wils the end without any deliberation, <hi>appetitu innato;</hi> and before any deliberation, there go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an act of the <hi>Will</hi> ſtill, whereby wee <hi>will</hi> deliberate upon ſuch a purpoſe, and it ſaith <hi>volo diliberere,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>minde</hi> enter in deliberation: when the <hi>will</hi> is ſet earneſtly upon a thing, it ſtirreth up the <hi>minde</hi> to thinke upon it, and upon the meanes whereby it may attaine unto it, that it may have the appetite ſatisfied; therefore the underſtanding cannot diſcerne a thing to be true or falſe, before the will appoint the end, and ſo ſet the minde on worke.</p>
               <p>There is a reciprocall dependance then betwixt theſe two, the <hi>Will</hi> dependeth upon the deliberation
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:173315:64"/>of the <hi>minde;</hi> both particularly ſetting downe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and how it ſhould exerciſe it ſelfe about the object;
<note place="margin">
                     <p>Duplex actus intellectus ſpecificationis &amp; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citij.</p>
                     <p>Voluntas ſequitur intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectum quoad ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem &amp; exercitium actus; intellectus ſequitur voluntatem quoad exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citium actus tantum.</p>
                  </note> but the mind dependeth upon the will, <hi>quoad exerciti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> but not, <hi>quoad ſpecificationem,</hi> for when the minde hath given out her laſt determination concerning any particular object, the will muſt chuſe that particular and not another, and neither refuſe it nor ſuſpend it; and it muſt chuſe it in that meaſure of earneſtneſſe, as it is knowne to be good; <hi>tantum quiſque vult quantum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligit ſe velle debere, every man deſireth ſo much as he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands.</hi> But upon the other ſide the <hi>will</hi> ſets onely the <hi>minde</hi> on worke, and conveneth the councell to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but telleth them not what to conclude, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth their deliberation, and promiſeth to follow their concluſion. <hi>Example,</hi> when a controverſie ariſeth in the Church the ſupreame magiſtrate conveneth a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node,</hi> and commandeth them to give out their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and Canon; but commandeth them not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline more to one ſide than to the other; here he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>exercitium,</hi> and leaves <hi>ſpecificationem</hi> free: but when hee hath heard their determination, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Word of God, hee taketh him to that ſide which they conclude to be beſt, without either ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or refuſing; and ſo followeth them both, <hi>quoad exercitium &amp; ſpecificationem:</hi> Yet in this ſimilitude there is ſome diſſimilitude; for the magiſtrate, yea every private man hath <hi>judicium diſcretionis;</hi> but the will hath no judgement in it ſelfe, for it meerely depends upon the judgement of the minde, which maketh the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of the dependance of the will upon the minde, to be greater than the dependance of the King upon his Councell, or of any private man, upon a <hi>Synods</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
               <p>This naturall reciprocation of the <hi>minde</hi> and the <hi>Will,</hi> is ſenſibly perceived, by the inſtruments of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:173315:65"/>
                  <hi>underſtanding</hi> and the <hi>will</hi> in the body, whereby they exerciſe their functions, to wit, the heart and the braine: the ſpirits are carried from the heart to the braine, and when the heart waxeth hoate with an earneſt deſire of the <hi>will,</hi> then the braine is more buſied, and intended to finde out the way how the heart may be ſatisfied; and againe when there is a cleare and a full knowledge in the braine, then the ſpirits runne from the braine to the heart, and ſtirre up the heart to purſue for the obtaining of the knowen good) which reciprocation bringeth foorth a happy worke when the unruly affections, and ſinful appetites, mixe not themſelves with the buſineſſe to marre all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether <hi>will</hi> we a thing firſt, or <hi>underſtand</hi> we it firſt, and then <hi>will</hi> it?</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We <hi>will</hi> a thing before wee <hi>underſtand</hi> it, by an inbred deſire and blinde appetite, but we cannot <hi>will</hi> a thing in reſpect of the meanes, untill the <hi>underſtanding</hi> give light firſt.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>habite</hi> of ſinne is firſt in the <hi>underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> becauſe all ſinne comes from error which is in the <hi>underſtanding.</hi> Againe, when the <hi>underſtanding</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by it ſelfe without any operation,
<note place="margin">In actu abſoluto pecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune eſt prius in intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu, in actu compeſito &amp; prius in voluntate.</note> then ſinne is firſt, in it; but when the <hi>underſtanding</hi> and the <hi>will</hi> worke together, then ſinne is firſt in the <hi>will.</hi>

               <p>Here wee may gather that the ſinne in the <hi>will</hi> is

                  <note place="margin">Triplex ignorantia, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedens, cancomitant, conſequens.</note> The firſt is called <hi>ignorantia antecedens,</hi> when a man is ignorant of that which hee is not bound to know, nor could not know, which if he had knowne he would not have done it; here, <hi>ignorance</hi> is the cauſe of the fact; as a man cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wood his axe head flees off and killes a man igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, he doth the thing ignorantly; which if hee had knowne he would not have done; here the <hi>ignorance</hi> in the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> makes not the <hi>will,</hi> willing, becauſe he ſinnes <hi>ex ignorantia.</hi>

A man conceives a hatred againſt ſuch a man, he miſtaking the man, kil les another in place of him ignorantly; when this is told him, hee is ſorry that he hath not killed his enemy; when hee killes the other man, his <hi>ignorance</hi> is not <hi>willing ignorance,</hi> neither is it <hi>unwilling ignorance:</hi>

               <p>The third is called <hi>ignorantia conſequens,</hi> when a man is wilfully ignorant, and drawes on the ignorance upon himſelfe, and then excuſeth his ſinne; a man in his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, killes a child ignorantly, this ignorance, is a willing ignorance, becauſe the man willingly was drunk, and contracted this ignorance; and therefore he ſhould be puniſhed both for his drunkenneſſe, and for his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this is called an <hi>affectate ignorance</hi> and willing.</p>

                  </note> We cannot call it a <hi>miracle;</hi> for there are two conditions required in a <hi>miracle.</hi> Firſt, that the cauſe which produceth the effect, be altogether unknowne to any creature; for if it be knowne to ſome, and not to others, it is not a <hi>miracle;</hi> the eclipſe of the Sunne, ſeemes to the country man a <hi>miracle,</hi> yet a <hi>Mathematician</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the reaſon of it, therefore it is not a miracle. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond condition required in a <hi>maracle</hi> is, that it be wrought in a thing which had an inclination to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect: as when God raiſeth the dead by his power, this is a <hi>miracle,</hi> becauſe it is not according to the nature of the dead that ever they ſhould riſe againe: So when Chriſt cured the blind, this was a <hi>miracle,</hi> for nature
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:173315:74"/>would never make a blinde man to ſee; ſo when Chriſt cured <hi>Peters</hi> mother in law of a feaver on a ſudden, this was a <hi>miracle,</hi> for nature could not doe this in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. If any of theſe two former conditions be lacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is not a <hi>Miracle.</hi> Therefore in the defect of the ſecond condition, the creation of the world is not a <hi>miracle,</hi> becauſe ſuch a great effect is proper to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſo glorious a cauſe: but if Man or Angel could create, it were a <hi>miracle,</hi> for it is contrary to their finite nature to produce ſuch an infinite effect. So, the creation of the Soule is not a <hi>miracle,</hi> becauſe God worketh ordinarily here, nature preparing the body, then God infuſeth the Soule. But if God ſhould create a Soule without this preparation of nature, this ſhould bee a <hi>miracle</hi> in reſpect of the ſecond condition: as when he created <hi>Eve</hi> without the helpe of <hi>Adam,</hi> and Chriſts manhood in the wombe of the Virgin,
<note place="margin">Creatio eſt opus mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, ſed non miraculum.</note> without the Virgine. So the converſion of Man is not a <hi>miracle,</hi> becauſe the reaſonable Soule was once created to the Image of God, and is againe capable of the grace of God. When wee heate cold water by fire, although it be contrary to the inclination of the forme of the water to bee hote, yet it may receive heate, and when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives heate it is not a <hi>miracle.</hi> But improperly the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> of Man may be ſaid to bee a <hi>miracle,</hi> in reſpect of the firſt condition required in a <hi>miracle,</hi> becauſe it is done by God who is an unknowne cauſe to us, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it bee not properly a <hi>miracle,</hi> becauſe the ſecond condition is deficient, yet it is a greater worke than a <hi>miracle, Nam aliquid eſt majus opus, ſed minus miraculum, ut creatio.</hi>

               <p>When the Fathers laboured to overthrow one error, they fell in another: as a gardner when hee goeth to make ſtraight a crooked ſprigge, he bends it ſome times too farre the other way: ſo they, that they might abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely defend the grace of God againſt the maintainers of <hi>freewill,</hi> they rooted out <hi>freewill,</hi> and gave man <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> in no actions, but concluded all under the neceſſity of Gods predeſtination as did the <hi>Stoickes</hi> among the heathen. But wee muſt not ſo ſtand in the defence of grace that we overthrow <hi>free-will,</hi> neither muſt wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe that to <hi>free-will,</hi> which is due to grace onely.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ieſuites</hi> that they may pleade for <hi>free-will</hi> in man, have found out a new platforme of mans ſalvation; for firſt, they eſtabliſh a <hi>middle ſort of knowledg in God;</hi> by which hee knoweth things that are to come,

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> When God lookes <hi>ad oppoſita,</hi> hee produceth his effects freely, and contingently, becauſe it muſt either be or not be; as the <hi>Keilites</hi> might have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or not delivered, <hi>David</hi> into the hands of <hi>Saul;</hi> but when God determinates himſelfe to one of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, then he abſolutely and neceſſarily foreknowes it; as hee knew abſolutely that <hi>David</hi> ſhould flee and not be betrayed: That which is contingent conditionally in the cauſe, may be infallibly neceſſary in the effect, as, if <hi>Peter runne, hee mooves;</hi> here hee mooves neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe hee runnes, and yet hee runnes not neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for hee may either runne or not runne: ſo this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of <hi>David</hi> was neceſſary in the effect if hee had ſtayed at <hi>Keilah,</hi> but it was contingent in the cauſe, for he might either have ſtayed there or not ſtayed.

When God wils a thing it comes
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:173315:76"/>not neceſſarily to paſſe; but when God wils a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, then it muſt come to paſſe: God wils the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe of the Sunne, he wills but this contingently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may either be or not be; but when he wills the eclipſe neceſſarily, then it muſt come to paſſe; <hi>in ſenſu conjuncto,</hi> that which he wills it muſt come to paſſe; but <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> that which hee will, may not come to paſſe; for hee needed not to have willed it: for as <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> in his Booke, <hi>contra gentiles</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quaedam eveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt ex neceſſitate ſuppoſitionis &amp; immutabilitatis, eo modo quo proviſa ſunt, ſciz contingenter &amp; liberè; ea quae Deus determinavit liberè &amp; contingenter eventura, ea contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genter evenient; &amp; neceſſariò quae determinavit neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nò.</hi> That is, <hi>ſome things fall out by neceſſitie of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and immutabilitie, that ſame way whereby they are foreſeene:</hi> to wit, <hi>contingently and freely; but thoſe things which God hath determinated to fall out contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and freely, they ſhall fall out contingently; and thoſe things that he hath determinate neceſſarily to come to paſſe, ſhall of neceſſetie be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Seeing the purpoſes of God are but abſolute, why are his promiſes and threatnings ſet downe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He ſets them downe conditionally to move ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners more earneſtly to repent, <hi>Ion.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Yet fortie dayes and Ninive ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> But hee keepes up the condition here, to move the <hi>Ninivites</hi> the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to repentance; and the event ſheweth, that this was Gods purpoſe not to deſtroy the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> becauſe they repented here by degrees he manifeſts his counſell unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example,</hi> when a towne is beleaguered, the Counſaile of warre ordaines that whoſoever goes upon the walles ſhall die the death, this is to terrifie ſouldiers, that they goe not upon the wals; the enemie make a ſudden aſſault
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:173315:77"/>in the night, a ſouldier runnes up upon the walles, and repells the enemy; whether ſhall this man die for it or not? the Counſell of warre explaines themſelves, and that which they ſet out abſolutely before, they interpret it now this way; our meaning was that no ſouldier ſhould goe up upon the walles that hee might not give intelligence to the enemy: but this ſouldier hath repelled the enemy; therefore hee hath not violated our Law, neither is he culpable of death. See the example of <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. So when God ſaith fortie dayes, and <hi>Ninive</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed, keeping up the condition, <hi>if they repented not;</hi> when they repent, he explaines his former ſentence, and ſhewes that it was not abſolutely his meaning they ſhould die, but onely to terrifie them, and to moove them to repentance.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> when they ſubordinate the <hi>Will</hi> of man, to the conditionall knowledge of God; they leave mans <hi>will</hi> indifferent here, to chuſe or not to chuſe; and upon this <hi>freedome</hi> of mans <hi>will,</hi> they ground the decree of God, to predeſtinate this man, and to reject that man. But if this platforme hold, then it will follow, that when the <hi>will</hi> of this man imbraceth grace,
<note place="margin">Voluntas neque eſt cauſa neque conditio predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationis ut Ieſuitae ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuunt.</note> and the <hi>will</hi> of that refuſeth it, it muſt either be the <hi>cauſe</hi> of predeſtination or the <hi>condition;</hi> but no Chriſtian ever ſaid that the <hi>will</hi> of man was the <hi>cauſe</hi> of predeſtination, except the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> and their followers; if they make this act of the <hi>will</hi> the condition of mans election, then they jumpe with the <hi>Arminians,</hi> who meaſure the efficacie of grace from the event of the <hi>will,</hi> which notwithſtanding ſome of the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> ſtrongly denie?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> If the <hi>will</hi> be neither the <hi>cauſe</hi> nor <hi>condition</hi> of our predeſtination, which is it then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is but a meane, for the fulfilling of mans prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination; for a mans name is not written in the Booke of life becauſe hee aſſents willingly, to the promiſes
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:173315:77"/>of the Goſpel, and beleeves them: but becauſe his name is written in the booke of life, therefore hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained unto eternall life beleeved.</hi> If a King ſhould diſcerne that none ſhould be courtiers with him, unleſſe they were trained firſt up in the warres; this trianing up in the warres is neither the <hi>cauſe</hi> not yet the <hi>condition,</hi> which mooves the King to make choiſe of them; it is a meane whereby they are received into the Court, but no motive which mooved the King. So, Faith whereby a man is adopted to be the Sonne of God, is neither the <hi>cauſe</hi> nor yet the <hi>condition</hi> which mooves God to elect Man, but whom he electeth freely, them he gives to beleeve.</p>
               <p>If it be asked of <hi>Bellermine,</hi> wherfore this man is ſaved and not that man? hee will anſwere that there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe but the good pleaſure and <hi>will</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if it bee asked of him; why he gives this man <hi>gratiam congruam,</hi> or fitting grace, and not that man? hee will anſwer: becauſe his will is to ſave this man, and not that man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if it be asked of him, wherefore this man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives grace and not that man? he will anſwere: becauſe grace is fitting for this man and not for that man: hee calles this <hi>fitting grace,</hi> not when the will is determinate by grace (as wee hold,) <hi>Phyſica determinatione,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Triplex determinatio, phyſica, eventu, &amp; moralis.</note> or <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perphyſica</hi> rather; neither will he make it to depend <hi>ab eventu,</hi> as the <hi>Arminians</hi> doe from the <hi>Will</hi> of man; but hee findes out a middle betwixt theſe two, placing it onely <hi>in morall perſwaſions,</hi> and the efficacy of the willes determination to depend upon Gods grace: for God (ſaith hee) foreſeeth,
<note place="margin">Duplex ſenſus, diviſus &amp; compoſitus.</note> that the will cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, becauſe hee hath fitted it ſo to the will, at this time and in this place; ſo that he cannot now <hi>abſolutely</hi> reject the grace of God, but <hi>conditionally:</hi> and he ſaith <hi>in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu diviſo</hi> hee may reject the grace of God; but not <hi>in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:173315:78"/>ſenſu compoſito. Example,</hi> when I ſee a man writing, he cannot but write; and yet conſidering this act of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by it ſelfe, he writes freely; ſo joyning Mans <hi>Will</hi> with Gods Decree, a man cannot but <hi>Will;</hi> and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the <hi>Will</hi> in it ſelfe, he may <hi>Will</hi> grace or not <hi>Will</hi> it when it is offered to him, becauſe grace doth deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate his <hi>Will</hi> (ſaith he) here he <hi>wills infallibiliter, ſed non neceſſariò.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dupliciter aliquis vult, infallibiliter, &amp; neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſario.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Arminians</hi> hold that the <hi>converſion</hi> of man altogether depends from his <hi>Will,</hi> and that there is no other cauſe why this man chuſeth and that man refuſeth grace, but onely the <hi>will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, if it be asked, whether or no this man may reſiſt the grace of God or not? he will anſwer; by the <hi>abſolute freedome</hi> of his <hi>will,</hi> hee may reſiſt it; by this it followeth that they will eſtabliſh a reall act in the <hi>will,</hi> which is neither ſubject to Gods providence, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination; but if they acknowledged the conſent of the will, to be a meane for the fulfilling of predeſtination, in this we would agree with them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Triplex gratia, ſufficiens abundans, &amp; efficax.</note> the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> that they may pleade for free will make three ſorts of <hi>grace, ſufficient, abundant,</hi> and <hi>effectuall grace,</hi> and they make <hi>abundant grace</hi> a higher degree than <hi>ſufficient grace;</hi> as that <hi>grace</hi> which was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida, Matth.</hi> 11. becauſe they had a more effectuall calling than <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon:</hi> they make that effectuall grace, when one actually receiveth the grace offered, and applyeth it to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But this diſtinction of <hi>grace</hi> cannot hold, for how can that be <hi>ſufficient grace,</hi> which never taketh effect, ſeeing none was ever ſaved, or ever ſhall be ſaved, by this <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient grace,</hi> which is not effectuall; <hi>ſufficient grace</hi> hath ever the owne effect, for whom God will have conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they cannot but be converted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19. <hi>VVho can reſiſt the will of God?</hi> Againe thoſe that are not
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:173315:78"/>converted, they of themſelves cannot be converted, God gives them neither willingneſſe nor <hi>ſufficient grace</hi> (to whom is he debter?) for if God gave them this willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then it ſhould be both <hi>ſufficient</hi> and <hi>effectuall grace</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>But we hold that both <hi>ſufficient</hi> and <hi>effectuall grace</hi> are the free gifts of God, becauſe, <hi>without me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ye can do nothing, Ioh.</hi> 15.5. Neither in <hi>ſufficient,</hi> nor in <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall grace.</hi> Againe, we hold that <hi>abundant</hi> and <hi>effectuall grace,</hi> are onely offered to the Elect; and that which was offered to <hi>Cherazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> was onely ſufficient to leave them inexcuſable and not to convert them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> plead for nature, holding that God concurres generally onely with the ſecond cauſes, in giving them a naturall power to worke; but not by mooving and applying them to their operations, as the Carpenter applyeth his axe to cut. Neither (ſay they) hath hee any influence in the action it ſelfe; aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing nothing to God, but the conſervation of the ſecond cauſes; and if hee worke with the ſecond cauſes,
<note place="margin">Becan. tract. de deo.</note> they make not man ſubordinate to God, but as two cauſes working together, as a weake and a ſtrong man carrying a loade.</p>
               <p>But we hold, that God not onely concurres generally with the ſecond cauſes, but applyes and mooves the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe to worke; not as the ſecond cauſes are <hi>co-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi> with God, but as <hi>ſubordinate;</hi> ſo that when God works upon his <hi>Will,</hi> he giveth not only a generall influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereby he ſuſtaines the <hi>Will;</hi> but alſo he hath a particular influence into it: neither is the will his fellow helper in the action, but ſubordinate to him, for in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of the effect God likewiſe concurs particularly.</p>

In his <hi>agonie</hi> they never diſturbed his <hi>reaſon,</hi> for in his agony they were like a glaſſe; which hath pure and cleane water in it, ſtirre the glaſſe and there ariſeth no mudde in it; but our <hi>paſsions</hi> antevert <hi>reaſon,</hi> they trouble and blind <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> they are like the foule glaſſe, when we ſtirre it, preſently it groweth dimme and the mudde ariſeth. The flowers of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that are continually watered by the waters of <hi>Nilus,</hi> (which are groſſe) yeeld not ſuch pleaſant ſmelles as other flowers doe: So our ſinfull paſſions are not ſo pure and cleare, for the vapours and exhalations that ariſe out of them from originall ſinne. Our <hi>paſsions</hi> are like the beardleſſe Counſellors of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam,</hi> who drew away the King to his deſtruction, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.8 Secondly, the <hi>paſsions</hi> in Chriſt differed from ours, <hi>quoad gradus,</hi> for when once his reaſon com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manded them to retreate and ſtay, they did proceed no further; therefore in Chriſt they might have rather beene called <hi>propaſsiones</hi> than <hi>paſsiones,</hi> becauſe they were the forerunners and beginners of <hi>paſsions,</hi> and might be ſtayed at pleaſure, and had no power to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his <hi>reaſon.</hi>

               <p>Some things are neither to bee prayſed, <hi>in ortu nec progreſſu,</hi> in their riſing nor proceeding, as hunger and thirſt, which are not ſubject to reaſon.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:173315:89"/>ſinne; it is like good Wine which is ſoone turned into Vinegar. Some paſſions are to be praiſed, both <hi>in ortu et progreſſu,</hi> and theſe were proper unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There was no contrariety and contradiction amongſt Chriſts paſſions.
<note place="margin">Inter Chriſti paſſiones nulla fuit contrarietas, inſtabilitas, aut impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitas.</note> Secondly, there was no inſtability in them. Thirdly, there was no importunity in them. But ſince the fall, there is a great contrariety and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction amongſt our paſſions, and great inſtabilitie, and great importunitie. <hi>In Chriſto fuerunt poenales ſed non culpabiles, in nobis ſunt poenales ſed et culpabiles: In Chriſt the paſsions were a puniſhment, but not a ſinne; but in us they are both a puniſhment and ſinne.</hi> Firſt, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety or contradiction; it is written in the life of <hi>An ſelme,</hi> when he walked in the field hee ſaw a ſhepheards boy, who had taken a bird and had tyed a ſtone to her legge, and as the bird mounted up, the ſtone drew her downe againe; which moved <hi>Anſelme</hi> to weepe, lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting how men indeavoured to flee up to heaven, and yet are ſtill borne downe to the earth by ſinne. Mens paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions now are like contrary winds or tides; covetous man that is given to adultery, is drawne by two wilde horſes contrary-wayes; for his covetouſneſſe bids him hold in, but his adultery bids him ſpend. Secondly, now our affections are inſtable, like the winds changing from this coaſt to that, like <hi>Amnon</hi> who now hated <hi>Thamar</hi> more than ever hee loved her before. Thirdly, now the affections importunate us, for ſometimes they lie ſicke as <hi>Ahab</hi> did, if they get not <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. or like <hi>Rachel</hi> who cried to <hi>Iacob, Give mee chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or elſe I die, Gen.</hi> 30. or like the horſeleech which hath two daughters, <hi>that cry continually, Give, give, Prov.</hi> 30.15.</p>

Hee began firſt with the Hogge, and demanded of him whether he would be a Man againe or not, he anſwered, that he was more contented with that ſort of life then he was before; for when he was a man he was troubled with a thouſand cares, and one griefe came continually after another; but now he had care for to fill the belly, and to lye downe in the dunghill and ſleepe: and ſo hee demanded of all the reſt about: but all of them refuſed to turne men againe, untill he came to the Elephant, who in his firſt eſtate had beene a Philoſopher; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, whether or not he would be a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; he anſwered that he would with all his heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew what was the difference betwixt a bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh and a reaſonable life. The application of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue is this. Theſe beaſtly creatures given over to their ſenſuall appetites, transformed and changed by Sathan into beaſts, in their hearts they deſire never to returne to a better eſtate, but to live ſtill in their ſwiniſh pleaſures, and to follow their ſenſuall appetites.</p>
               <p>But theſe who have the Spirit of Grace in them, and are fallen into ſome haynous ſin, having taſted of both the eſtates, like the Elephant they deſire to be backe at their firſt eſtate againe.</p>

Secondly, it lets us ſee the firſt motions of the heart (which are without conſent) to be ſin: and as in a cleare ſun-ſhine wee ſee atomos, the little motes which are the leaſt thing, that the eye of man can perceive: So the Law of God lets us ſee the firſt motions, aryſing from originall ſinne, to be finne before God. Thirdly, <hi>Divinitie</hi> lets us ſee, that unadviſed anger is a ſinne before God. Fourthly, it lets us ſee, that, <hi>Hee who cals his brother raca, is to be puniſhed by the Councell, Mat.</hi> 5.22. Fiftly, it lets us ſee what a ſinne the fact it ſelfe is.

So if wee reſpect the worke it ſelfe, the good workes of the Gentiles are not ſinnes, and in this ſenſe it is ſaid, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.30. <hi>Iehu did that which was good in the ſight of the Lord.</hi> So, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.26 <hi>thou didſt this in the integritie of thy heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if wee conſider theſe vertues according to the Goſpell, then we muſt call them ſinnes,
<note place="margin">Opera gentilium ſine fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, pecca ſunt,</note> becauſe they proceeded not from faith; <hi>For without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſsible to pleaſe God, Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we reſpect the end of their workes,
<note place="margin">Opera gentilium reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu finis ſunt peccata.</note> they are ſinnes, becauſe they did them not for the glory of God, but for their owne prayſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in reſpect of the ſubject of their good works,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:173315:94"/>becauſe the perſons were not renued who did them. If the perſon be not renued, his workes cannot be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before God. <hi>Aurichalcum, latten</hi> or <hi>copper,</hi> is called a falſe mettall, not becauſe it is a falſe ſubſtance, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is falſe gold. So theſe workes of the heathen, are falſe <hi>vertues,</hi> becauſe they proceed not from faith; but they are not ſimply falſe.</p>

                  </note> Againe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.13. Chriſt is brought in, <hi>with his girdle about his paps;</hi> to ſignifie that Ieſus Chriſt ſubdued, not onely his <hi>ſenſitive faculties</hi> but alſo the <hi>intellectuall,</hi> in his <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>underſtanding;</hi> and it was for this that the High Prieſt under the law was forbidden to we are his girdle, <hi>about his ſweating places, Ezek.</hi> 44.18. that is, about his middle, as the <hi>Chal. de Paraphraſe</hi> interpreteth it, not beneath, but about his pappes; to ſignifie the moderation of all his <hi>paſsions;</hi> It is a true axiome; <hi>quod operatur Chriſtus pro nobis, oper atur in nobis; that which Chriſt doth for us, he doth in us:</hi> He ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his owne paſſions,
<note place="margin">Reconciliando.</note> that He may ſubdue our <hi>paſsions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt reconciles the <hi>paſsions,</hi> which ſtrive ſo one againſt another: <hi>Iudg.</hi> 17.6. <hi>when there was no King in Iſrael, every man might doe what hee pleaſed;</hi> ſo theſe paſſions doe what they pleaſe, contradicting one another, till Chriſt come in to reconcile them. <hi>Moſes</hi> when he ſaw two Hebrewes ſtriving together, he ſayd, <hi>ye are brethren, why doe ye ſtrive? Exod.</hi> 2.13. So when Chriſt ſeeth the <hi>paſsions</hi> ſtriving one with another, Hee ſaith, <hi>Yee are brethren, why doe yee ſtrive? Acts</hi> 7.24.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Rectificando.</note> Chriſt ſets the <hi>paſsions</hi> upon their right ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, whereas before they were ſet upon the wrong objects, and he turnes theſe inordinate deſires the right way. A man takes a bleeding at the noſe, the way to ſtay the bloud is to divert the courſe of it, and open a veine in the arme. So the Lord draweth the paſſions from their wrong objects, and turnes them to another. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was given to uncleane luſt, the Lord diverted this ſinfull paſſion, and ſhe became penitent, and thirſted after grace, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.2. So hee turned the paſſions of <hi>Saul</hi> when he was a bloudy murtherer, to thirſt for grace, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. We know a womans appetite to be a falſe appetite, when ſhee deſireth to eate raw
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:173315:95"/>fleſh, or coales, or ſuch traſh: and that ſhee is mending againe when her appetite is ſet upon wholſome meates. So when the paſſions are ſet upon wrong objects, then a man is in the eſtate of ſinne: but when the <hi>paſsions</hi> are turned to the right objects, then a man becomes the child of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> when Chriſt hath ſent theſe paſſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right object,
<note place="margin">Immobiliter perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendo.</note> hee ſettles them that they cannot bee mooved; for as the needle in the compaſſe trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth ſtill, till it bee directly ſetled towards the North pole; then it ſtands. So the affections are never ſetled, till they bee ſet upon the right object, and there he tyes them, that they ſtart not away againe, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 86.9. <hi>David</hi> prayeth, <hi>knit my heart to thee, O Lord.</hi> The beaſts when they were brought to be made a ſacrifice, were tyed with cords to the hornes of the Altar, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 118.27. that they might not ſtart away againe: So the Lord muſt tye the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the right objects that they ſtart not away againe.</p>
               <p>The paſſions are either in the <hi>concupiſcible</hi> or <hi>iraſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> part of the Soule. There be ſix paſſions in the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcible appetite; Love, hatred, deſire, abomination, pleaſure, ſadneſſe.</hi>

                     </label> he is the firſt true cauſe, by giving knowledge to the underſtanding: he is the laſt good end, by rectifing the will; therefore the underſtanding never contents it ſelfe, untill it know God, and the will never reſts til it come to the laſt good end; God is A to the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and Ω to the <hi>will.</hi> He is mans chiefe good, therefore he is to be preferred to all things, both to our owneſelves, and to thoſe things we count moſt of, beſide our ſelves wherefore, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. he faith; <hi>He that loveth his life bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> So <hi>Math.</hi> 10. <hi>He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his father or mother better than me, is not worthy of me;</hi> ſo hee that preferres his owne <hi>love</hi> before God; is not worthy of the love of God.</p>
                  <p>There are three ſorts of <hi>love;
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Illuſt. </seg>2</label> emanans,</hi> or natural love; <hi>imperatus;</hi> or commanded love: <hi>elicitus,</hi> or love freely proceeding.
<note place="margin">Triplex amor, emanans, imperdius, &amp; elicitus.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Naturall love</hi> is that <hi>love,</hi> whereby every thing hath an inclination naturally to the like, as heavie things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally goe downe to the center of the earth: beaſts are carried by ſenſe and inſtinct to their objects, the Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire in Summer layeth up proviſion againſt the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.8.

                  <p>Commanded love is that, whereby reaſon ſheweth us ſome good thing to be <hi>loved,</hi> and then our will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us to <hi>love</hi> the ſame.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Love,</hi> proceeding freely is that, when the affections make choyce of God freely; when as they conſider his goodneſſe that breeds <hi>admiration</hi> in them: when they doe conſider his beauty, that breeds love in them, and his ſweetneſſe doth ſatisfie their whole deſires; ſo that nothing is ſo worthy an obiect to bee beloved as God, who hath all theſe properties in him.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>love</hi> that lookes to filthineſſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſtie, ſuch was the <hi>love</hi> which <hi>Putiphars</hi> wife car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Ioſeph Gen.</hi> 39.9. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was not bound to <hi>love Putiphars</hi> wife againe, in this ſort of <hi>love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third ſort of <hi>love</hi> is moſt pure and holy <hi>love,</hi> and in this love wee are bound to <hi>love</hi> backe againe.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> God cannot be directly the object of our <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: bonum in univerſali,</hi> cannot be hated; God is both truth and goodneſſe; therefore he cannot be hated. The underſtanding lookes to truth, and the will to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; God is both truth and goodneſſe; therefore hee
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:173315:107"/>cannot be hated in himſelfe, but in ſome particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; as men hate him, becauſe he inflicteth the evill of puniſhment upon them, or becauſe hee commandeth them ſomething, which they thinke hard to doe; as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining them in their pleaſure or profit.</p>
               <p>So the wicked they hate not the word as the word, but as it croſſeth their lewd appetites, and curbes their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Am I become your enemie becauſe I tell you the truth?</hi> The ſheepe hates not the Wolfe, as it is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creature; for then it ſhould hate the Oxe alſo; but the Sheepe hates the Wolfe as hurtfull to it; and in this ſenſe Men are ſaid to be haters of God.</p>
               <p>Theſe who behold that infinite good, cannot hate him, but of neceſſity love him; therefore the ſin of the divels was, the turning away of their ſight from God, and the reflection of their underſtanding upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, admiring their owne ſublimity, remembring their ſubordination to God; this grieved them, wherby they were drowned with the conceite of their owne pride; whereupon their <hi>delection, adoration,</hi> and <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of God and goodneſſe were interrupted.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The <hi>hatred</hi> of God, and the <hi>ignorance</hi> of God, are conſidered two wayes; either as <hi>hatred</hi> includes <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> or as they are ſeverally conſidered. As <hi>hatred</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>ignorance,</hi> then <hi>hatred</hi> is a greater ſinne than <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:173315:107"/>becauſe he that <hi>hates</hi> God muſt be <hi>ignorant</hi> of him.</p>
               <p>But if we conſider them ſeverally; then ignorance is to be diſtinguiſhed into <hi>ignorantia purae negationis,</hi> and <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantia pravae diſpoſitionis;</hi> and this latter <hi>ignorance,</hi> proceeding from a perverſe diſpoſition of the Soule which will not know God, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſayd, <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould know him, and obey his voyce? Exod.</hi> 5.2. muſt be a greater ſin than hatred, for ſuch <hi>ignorance</hi> is the cauſe of <hi>hatred;</hi> and in vices the cauſe muſt bee worfe then the effect: but <hi>perverſe ignorance</hi> is the cauſe of the <hi>hatred</hi> of God. Therefore this ſort of <hi>ignorance,</hi> is a greater ſinne than the <hi>hating</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>We muſt not then underſtand the <hi>axiome</hi> according to the firſt fence here; for there is no contrarietie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>ignorance;</hi> becauſe the one includes the other. But where they are ſeverally confidered, then the rule holds in theſe oppoſitions which are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite in the ſame reſpect; as one contrary to another, one contradictory to another; if white bee the moſt bright colour,
<note place="margin">Duplex oppoſitio, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietatis &amp; contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionis.</note> then blacke muſt be the moſt darke co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: here the axiome holds, becauſe there is a direct oppoſition in contrariety of the ſame kind. So, good is to be followed, good is not to be followed: this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition holds in contradiction of the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>But this rule will not hold betwixt a contrary and a contradictory joyned together, <hi>ſecundùm gradus perfectionis:</hi> as, <hi>love</hi> is a greater vertue than <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> therefore <hi>not to love</hi> is a greater vice than <hi>hatred:</hi> this doth not follow; for <hi>hatred</hi> is a greater vice, than not to love.</p>
               <p>Now, when the <hi>hatred</hi> of God, and the <hi>ignorance</hi> of God are compared together, with their oppoſites <hi>love</hi> &amp; <hi>knowledge, ſecundùm oppoſitionem et comparativè, love</hi> and <hi>hatred</hi> are oppoſed contrarily; but <hi>knowledge</hi> and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:173315:108"/>
                  <hi>ignorance</hi> are oppoſed privately and contradictory.</p>
               <p>Now there is a greater oppoſition betwixt two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictories,
<note place="margin">Quae opponuntur pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vativè vel contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riè magis opponuntur quàm quae contrariè; ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re &amp; ignorare contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictoriè opponuntur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare &amp; odiſſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riè.</note> than betwixt two contraries; therefore the <hi>ignorance</hi> of God muſt be a greater ſinne, then the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of God: and here the Axiome holds. The miſery of the damned (it is thought,) conſiſts not ſo much in the want of the <hi>love</hi> of God, as the want of the ſight of God.</p>

               <p>Some of the good Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> tooke away the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolles, <hi>but yet the high places were not removed,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 12.4. the reaſon of this is, becauſe, <hi>Idolatrie is a worke of the fleſh, Gal.</hi> 5.20.

The <hi>hatred of enmitie</hi> is when Chriſt willeth the puniſhment of the perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the evill he is defiled with: hee will have a man to be puniſhed as a wicked man, but not as a man.

               <p>Some againe hate the perſon for the good found in them; as, <hi>O di Michaiam, I hate him,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.8.

                  <p>The remedies to cure this ſinfull <hi>hatred</hi> are: firſt, conſider that the man whom thou hateſt moſt, may be helpfull to thee againe. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> once moſt hated of his brethren, yet neceſſitie mooved them to love him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. So the Elders of <hi>Gilead</hi> who did hate <hi>Iephteh</hi> and expelled him out of his fathers houſe, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 11.7. but when the time of tribulation came, he became their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved head and Captaine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if we would make good uſe of our <hi>hatred,</hi> we muſt employ it againſt vice, and againſt theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the love and purſuite whereof may pollute the heart, and blemiſh the image of God which ſhineth in our ſoules.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if we ſhould cure <hi>hatred,</hi> we muſt repreſent the miſeries which doe commonly accompany the purſuites of envy; we muſt ſet before our eyes the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of ſo many famous perſons, that have loſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon this ſhelfe, and wee muſt repreſent to our ſelves the croſſes, paines, and torments which this wretched paſſion doth cauſe.</p>

               <p>This will of reaſon made <hi>Scevola</hi> to hold his hand in the fire untill it burnt.

               <p>Chriſts humane will was conforme to the will of the Godhead, in the thing willed formally; that is,
<note place="margin">Duplex est velle, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, &amp; materiale.</note> when hee beheld this cup, as the middle to purchaſe mans ſalvation; but it was divers from it, conſidering the cup materially in it ſelfe, as it was a bitter cup.</p>
               <p>Example when a Iudge wils a theefe to bee hanged, and the wife of this theefe wils him not to bee hanged, for her owne private weale; here is no contrarietie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:173315:111"/>the two wils. But if the wife of the theefe, ſhould will her husband to live, as an enemy to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, then her will ſhould be contrary to the Iudges will.</p>
               <p>This <hi>naturall will</hi> in Chriſt hindred not his divine and reaſonable will; and it willed nothing but that which theſe <hi>wils</hi> willed it to <hi>will,</hi> for they had the abſolute commandement over it: neither was there any ſtrife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, as betwixt the fleſh and the ſpirit in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. but ſtill a ſubordination.</p>
               <p>The ſubordination of the wils in Chriſt,

So our Lord willed not abſolutely to drinke this cuppe, but ſeeing that God his Father had determinate this way, that mans ſalvation ſhould bee purchaſed, Chriſt would drinke this cup.</p>
               <p>In Chriſts <hi>deſires</hi> there was no reluctation,
<note place="margin">A collation betwixt the ſecond, renned and old <hi>Adam.</hi>

               <p>But the <hi>wils</hi> of the unregenerate, are no wayes ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the will of God. When Chriſt ſaith,

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Duplex intentio ſuit Dei in creatione, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria &amp; ſecundaria.</note> God in the creation had a double <hi>intention</hi> or purpoſe; his <hi>principall,</hi> and <hi>ſecundary purpoſe:</hi> his <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall purpoſe</hi> was, <hi>ut individua &amp; ſpecies propagentur &amp; conſerventur;</hi> that particular things might be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and their kinds preſerved; and for this he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>delight</hi> to ſerve for their <hi>operations,</hi> as hunger to give appetite to meate.</p>
               <p>His <hi>ſecondary purpoſe</hi> was (reſpecting the beaſts) by putting a naturall inclination in them <hi>to doe,</hi> that they might attaine <hi>pleaſure.</hi>

               <p>Example, when the lawe is made, which propoſeth rewards of <hi>wel-doing,</hi> the law of the firſt intention pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, that men ſhould give themſelves to <hi>wel-doing,</hi> and ordaines rewards onely for that; but in the ſecond place as acceſſary, it intends, that he which is ſtirred up by rewards ſhould ſeeke his reward for <hi>wel-doing:</hi> in the firſt he lookes to <hi>wel-doing,</hi> and then to the reward; in the ſecond being ſtirred up by the reward he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to <hi>doe well.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Of Sadneſſe and griefe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>SAdneſſe is a paſsion of the ſoule which ariſeth from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment that we have received from the objects, contrary to her inclination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sadneſſe</hi> differeth from <hi>dolour</hi> or <hi>griefe,</hi> for <hi>Sadneſſe</hi> is properly in the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and that is called <hi>heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> but <hi>griefe</hi> is onely in the <hi>ſenſitive part,</hi> and it is common to men and beaſts. Secondly, <hi>ſadneſſe</hi> is of things paſt, preſent, and to come, becauſe it followeth the <hi>underſtanding</hi> that comprehendeth all theſe times; but <hi>griefe</hi> is onely of things preſent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt Adam</hi> before his fall had no <hi>ſadneſſe;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A Collation betwixt the innocent, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe as yet he had not ſinned: but the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> Ieſus Chriſt, taking the puniſhment of our ſinnes upon him, had great <hi>ſadneſſe,</hi> carrying the burden of the ſinnes of all the elect, both paſt, preſent, and to come.</p>
               <p>There was a double <hi>ſadneſſe</hi> in Chriſt: the firſt,
<note place="margin">Duplex triſtitia in Chriſto; paſſionis, &amp; compaſſionis,</note> was of <hi>paſsion,</hi> the ſecond, of <hi>compaſsion,</hi> he was much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the paines he ſuſtained himſelfe, then <hi>doluit;</hi> but much more for that which he had in <hi>compaſsion</hi> for us, for then <hi>condoluit.</hi> Wee in the ſtate of corruption are more grieved for that which we ſuffer our ſelves, than we can be grieved for any other: but Chriſt was more grieved for us, that we were ſeparate from God.</p>
               <p>Againe, they marke, that Chriſt <hi>compatitur nobis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chriſtus compatitur no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, ratione charitatis &amp; ratione juſtitiae.</note> he had pity upon us, either by way of <hi>charity,</hi> as when he ſaw the people hungry in the wilderneſſe he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion upon them. So when he wept for <hi>Ieruſalem, Mat.</hi> 23. or by way of <hi>obligation,</hi> when he was bound by <hi>obligation</hi> to ſatisfie for us upon the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob. Sadneſſe</hi> is of theſe things which befall us againſt
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:173315:118"/>our will, but nothing befell to Chriſt againſt his will, therefore <hi>ſadneſſe</hi> was in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>

                  </note> beſides the command of reaſon; as theſe <hi>firſt motions</hi> which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſudden doe ſurpriſe men. Secondly, there is a <hi>ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, contrajudicium rationis,</hi> againſt the judgement of reaſon,
<note place="margin">Triſtitia exſurgit prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, contra, vel ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum rationis imperium.</note> which ſubdueth reaſon for a while, and this may be alſo in the children of God.

               <p>
                  <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> interpreting theſe words of <hi>Seneca, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia turbans non eſt in ſapiente,</hi> expounds it well; <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitia perturbans non eſt in ſapiente:</hi> although <hi>ſadneſſe</hi> trouble a wiſe man, yet it perturbs him not; for a man not to be <hi>ſad</hi> when he ought to be <hi>ſad, eſt durities et non ſapientia,</hi> it is hardneſſe of heart and not wiſedome; <hi>rejoyce with thoſe that rejoyce, and weepe with thoſe that weepe, Rom.</hi> 12.

               <p>The <hi>ſuperior faculties</hi> of the ſoule are taken <hi>largely</hi> both in the <hi>underſtanding</hi> and the <hi>will,</hi> when they looke not only to God immediately, but alſo to the meanes which leade to eternity; as to the ſufferings, paines and griefe, which it is to undergoe before it come hither; they are taken <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> looking onely to eternall things as eternall, and reſpecting onely God himſelfe. When Chriſts ſoule beheld immediately God and mans ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then it was not <hi>ſad,</hi> but when he beheld the means leading unto this ſalvation, here aroſe the <hi>ſadneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They cleare the matter further by this compariſon. A man that is leaprous, the Doctor preſcribes him to drink ſome poiſon for his health: now in his underſtanding he conceiveth what a good thing his health is, and in that hee rejoyceth; there is no <hi>ſadneſſe</hi> in the underſtanding here, taking the underſtanding <hi>ſtrictly;</hi> ſo hee wils his health, taking the will <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> and there is no ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in it neither; but when he wils his health by this phyſicke, and remembers that he muſt drinke this poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; here comes in the <hi>ſadneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was <hi>griefe</hi> and <hi>ſadneſſe,</hi> in Chriſts ſoule,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Conſeq. </seg>
                  </label> both in the <hi>ſuperior</hi> and <hi>inferior faculties;</hi> therefore theſe who hold that Chriſt ſuffered onely in his ſoule by <hi>ſimpathy,</hi> from the paines which aroſe from the body, &amp; not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly in his ſoule; extenuate mightily our Lords ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; for the ſoule of Chriſt was immediately the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the wrath of God, and therfore the Prophet <hi>Eſay cha</hi> 55 9 calleth them <hi>his deaths,</hi> becauſe he ſuffered the <hi>first death,</hi> and the equivalent of the <hi>ſecond death</hi> for us.</p>
               <p>The dignity of Chriſts perſon, 1. made him acceptable in the ſight of God, 2. it made his ſufferings to be meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, 3. his ſufferings were meritorious for compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in circumſtances, but not in ſubſtance: therefore death it ſelf could not be remitted to him, neither <hi>griefe, horror,</hi> nor <hi>ſadneſſe,</hi> in the firſt two reſpects. But becauſe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:173315:119"/>ſome things were unbeſeeming the perſon of Chriſt (as the torments of hel,) the compenſation of this was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the worthineſſe of the perſon; yet he ſuffered the equivalent of it, in paine and ſmart, and this bred his <hi>ſorrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Example,</hi> a man is owing a ſumme of money to his neighbour, either he payes him back againe in the ſame kind, as gold for gold, or by the equivalent, as ſilver for gold; and this is ſufficient to diſcharge the ſumme. So Chriſt payed the equivalent of the paines of hell to God his Father.</p>
               <p>If a man be owing his neighbour ſuch a ſumme, either he muſt pay it, or goe to priſon; to goe to the priſon is not a part of the ſumme, for if he pay it before he goe to priſon, hee hath ſatisfied the debt. So Chriſt ſuffering theſe paines for us, although he deſcended not really into hell to ſuffer, yet he payed the debt, and for this his ſoule was heavy even unto the death, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.38.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſadneſſe</hi> of the regenerate is a <hi>ſadneſſe</hi> that hath reſpect to God,
<note place="margin">A collation betwixt the renued and old <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> which bringeth ſalvation; but the <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> of the worldlings brings death to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>The ſadneſſe which is towards God brings repentance to ſalvation which is not to bee repented of: but the ſadneſſe of the world brings death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Can <hi>godly ſorrow</hi> make a man ſad, ſeeing God is the moſt comfortable object?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The beholding of God in himſelfe can bring no <hi>ſadneſſe</hi> to man, for he is a moſt comfortable object: but the beholding of ſinne which hindreth us from the cleare ſight of that object which is moſt comfortable, it is that which breedes the <hi>ſorrow</hi> in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>

<note place="margin">Duplex objectum triſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae, verum, &amp; falſum.</note> it muſt be turned to the right object.

                  <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Verum objectum triſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae, vel eſt in defectu, vel exceſſu.</note> when the paſſion is ſet upon the right ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, if the paſſion be in defect: then the paſſion muſt be more ſharpened, as the ſayles are to be hoyſed up when it is too calme; but if the paſſion be too vehement, then it muſt be moderate; for if the wind bee too great, then the ſayles muſt be pulled downe a little.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, reaſon muſt ſharply cenſure this paſſion,

                  <p>Hope, <hi>is a paſsion of the ſoule, that we have of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion of future good, which preſents it ſelfe to our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, as difficult to obtaine, whereby we endeavour to purſue it, conceiving that wee are able to attaine unto it, and in the end to get the poſſeſsion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hope</hi> differeth from <hi>deſire,</hi> which extends it ſelfe to all kinde of good, without any apprehenſion of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:173315:121"/>and therefore <hi>deſire</hi> belongeth to the <hi>concupiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appetite;</hi> whereas <hi>hope</hi> is ſubject to the <hi>Iraſcible,</hi> and reſpecteth the future good gotten with difficulty, for no man did ever <hi>hope</hi> for things which hee holdeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to attaine unto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hope</hi> is conſidered here as a naturall vertue in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and not as a theologicall or ſupernaturall vertue, as it is in us now, and it is placed in the ſoule, <hi>ut operationem expeditam reddat,</hi> that it may further man in his operation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.10. <hi>hee that plougheth, plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in hope, and he that threſheth, ſhould bee partaker of his hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt Adam</hi> had <hi>hope</hi> to injoy the life to come,

                     </note> and to bee tranſlated to a better eſtate, if hee continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in obedience; this <hi>hope</hi> was naturall to him, and hee hoped without difficultie to obtaine the thing <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi> for;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Secunda ſecundae, q.</hi> 13 <hi>art.</hi> 3.</note> for as <hi>Thomas</hi> ſheweth well, this difficulty of hardneſſe to obtaine the thing hoped for, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes neceſſarily required in him that hopes; <hi>nam ſpes etiam verſatur circa bonum facile; Hope</hi> may bee exerciſed about that which is eaſie to obtaine; but the true reaſon wherefore <hi>hope</hi> is ſaid to bee of things hardly obtained is this, becauſe hee that <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth,</hi> hath one above him who is more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full than hee is, who may performe that which hee hopeth for; and herein ſtands the reaſon of this why it is ſaid <hi>hardly to bee obtained,</hi> becauſe wee hope, that that muſt bee performed by another, though it bee not hard to bee obtained in it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>So the <hi>firſt Adam, hoped</hi> that God would performe that which he <hi>hoped</hi> for without any difficulty.

                  <p>The <hi>hope</hi> in the glorified, although it be evacuate in the life to come touching the ſubſtance of our bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet touching the adjuncts of this glory,
<note place="margin">Polanus in ſyntagmate.</note> they ſay we may have <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> ſtill: as the ſoules glorified <hi>beleeve</hi> the ſecond comming of Chriſt, and they <hi>hope</hi> for the riſing of the body, &amp; the perfection of the Church. But when it is objected, how can <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>viſion</hi> ſtand together, for faith and hope are of things not ſeene, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. They anſwer, That they cannot ſtand together touching one object, and in the ſame reſpect; for they ceaſe in the life to come, when the ſoule beholds God the moſt <hi>abſolute object,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dulpex objectum glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatorum, abſolutum &amp; ſecundarim.</note> but yet in reſpect of <hi>ſecondary objects,</hi> and things yet not accompliſhed, which the Saints beleeve ſhall be accompliſhed; relying upon the authority of him who hath promiſed, not ſeeing them yet by ſight as they doe God himſelfe: in this reſpect they ſay, that <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> are not yet altogether abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the heavens.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>hope</hi> of the unregenerate, is but <hi>ſomnium vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> a waking mans dreame: for as dreames in the night fill us with illuſions, and vaine formes, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe us and make us imagine that we are rich in our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt povertie and greateſt miſery: So <hi>hope</hi> abuſing the imagination of the unregenerate, fills their ſoules with vaine contentments.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>DEſpaire</hi> is contrary to <hi>Hope.</hi> There are two kindes of oppoſitions in the paſſions of the ſoule; the firſt is found amongſt theſe, that have contrary things for their objects, and that is
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:173315:122"/>onely amongſt the paſſions of the <hi>concupiſcible part;</hi> as betwixt <hi>love</hi> and <hi>hatred,</hi> whereof the one regards the <hi>good,</hi> and the other the evill, which are two contraries and can never be in one ſubject together, at one time in the ſame reſpect. The ſecond oppoſition is obſerved, betwixt theſe that regard the ſame object, but with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers conſiderations, and that is found amongſt the <hi>iraſcible paſsions,</hi> whereof the one ſeekes the good of the object, &amp; the other flees it, by reaſon of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which doth inviron it. <hi>Example: courage,</hi> and <hi>feare,</hi> doe both regard an imminent danger, which preſents it ſelfe to the imagination: but <hi>courage</hi> lookes upon it to encounter with it and vanquiſh it. <hi>Feare</hi> regards it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide it, and flee from it; and ſo <hi>deſpaire</hi> is contrary to <hi>hope</hi> after this manner: for the object of <hi>hope</hi> (which is a good, difficult to be obtained) drawes us upon the one ſide ſo farre as we imagine a power to obtaine: but <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire</hi> doth reſpect it on the other ſide, when we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that by no meanes we can enjoy it, then we give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and <hi>deſpaire.</hi> This paſſion of <hi>deſpaire</hi> was neither in the <hi>firſt,</hi> nor <hi>ſecond Adam.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> All paines of the damned ought to be ſuffered by Chriſt, but <hi>deſpaire</hi> is a paine of the damned; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought to have beene ſuffered by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.
<note place="margin">Deſperatio non eſt poena ſed adjunctum peccati.</note> Deſperation</hi> is not a paine or a cauſe of the paine properly, but an adjunct or conſequent of the ſinne in the ſinner, that ſuffereth puniſhment, ariſing from an inward cauſe. Chriſt had no griefe of conſcience which is an adjunct of ſinne in the wicked, ſo neither had hee <hi>deſpaire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a ſhameleſſe ſlander in thoſe who charge <hi>Calvine</hi> as though he gave out that theſe words of Chriſt <hi>(my God,
<note place="margin">Comment ſuper Math. cap.</note> my God, why haſt thou for ſaken me,)</hi> were words of <hi>deſpaire:</hi> hee accurſeth ſuch helliſh blaſphemie, and ſheweth that howſoever the fleſh apprehended
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:173315:122"/>deſtroying evils, and <hi>inferiour reaſon</hi> ſheweth no iſſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out of the ſame; yet there was ever a moſt ſure reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved perſwaſion reſting in his heart, that hee ſhould undoubtedly prevaile againſt them, and overcome them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether is <hi>infidelity</hi> and the <hi>hating</hi> of God a greater ſinne than <hi>deſpaire,</hi> or not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Infidelity</hi> and <hi>hating</hi> of God in themſelves,
<note place="margin">Differentia inter odium &amp; deſperationem.</note> are more hainous ſinnes than <hi>deſpaire;</hi> for they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt God, who is in himſelfe truth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but <hi>deſpaire</hi> is onely againſt God: becauſe the wretched ſinner cannot perceive his goodneſſe to him, therefore it is not ſo great a ſinne as the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether is <hi>preſumption</hi> or <hi>deſpaire</hi> the greater ſinne?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Deſpaire</hi> is a greater ſinne than <hi>preſumption,</hi>

When he puniſheth, <hi>he puniſheth to the third and fourth generation; but he ſheweth mercy to the thouſandth generation, Exod.</hi> 20.6. therefore it muſt be a greater ſin to contemne his <hi>mercy</hi> than his <hi>juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deſpaire</hi> makes a man contemne Gods <hi>mercy,</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption</hi> his <hi>juſtice.</hi> As <hi>deſpaire</hi> is a turning from God; ſo preſumption is an immoderate converſion to God: preſumption makes a man think to obtaine mercy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance; but deſpaire makes him thinke it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to obtaine mercy though with repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deſperation</hi> in men is either ſudden, or longer ad vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Againe, it is either under the ſenſe of Gods wrath as <hi>Iudas</hi> was; or under the Croſſe as many of the pagans; or under the rage of melancholly or frenſie: therefore men that are to fight with this monſter, let them reſort to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:173315:123"/>the word of God, and take it to be his ſecond, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all uſe theſe remedies following.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The remedies to cure this paſsion.</head>
                  <p>That we may cure this paſſion of <hi>deſpaire;</hi> Firſt, we muſt remember the great mercies of God: if we reſpect the dimenſions in corporall things, and apply them to things ſpirituall, as the Apoſtle doth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.18. where he ſpeaketh of the <hi>breadth, length, depth, and height of the love of God which paſſeth all knowledge,</hi> that we might be filled with all fulneſſe of God. So let us apply theſe dimenſions to the mercy of God, and wee ſhall finde it moſt comfortable. For the latitude and bredth of Gods mercy, let us remember that which <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia tua plena eſt terra, Pſal.</hi> 33.5. For the length of his mercy, let us remember that which the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> ſingeth in her ſong, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.50. <hi>And his mercy is from one generation to many generations, to them that feare him.</hi> For the depthh of his mercy, as it is a fearefull thing to looke into the gulph of our ſinnes as <hi>Cain</hi> did: So it is a comfortable thing to look into the depth of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>that where ſin hath abounded, grace may ſuper abound, Rom.</hi> 5.20. Then for the great height of Gods mercy, what can wee ſee next under God higher than the heavens? yet the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108. <hi>verſe</hi> 5. <hi>Thy mercies are exalted above the heavens.</hi> And for the indurance of his mercy <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100. <hi>verſe</hi> 17. that it is <hi>ab aeterno in aeternum.</hi> Concerning the multitude of his mercies ſome have ſought to reduce them to ſeven, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>Matthew chapter</hi> 18. <hi>verſe</hi> 2. but ſeeing Chriſt wills us, not onely, <hi>to forgive ſeven times, but ſeventy times ſeven times;</hi> much more will he, <hi>Math.</hi> 18.22.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, remember that although thy ſinnes were
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:173315:123"/>red like the ſcarlet, yet hee can make them white as the ſnow, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 1.18. Scarlet in the He brew it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> twice becauſe it is twice dipped: wee cannot waſh this dye out of the ſcarlet againe: but although wee be dyed once, twice, thrice in ſinne, by recidivations, and falling againe into ſinne, yet the mercy of God is ſuch that he can waſh out all thoſe ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when God lookes upon the ſinnes of his Saints through Chriſt; <hi>he ſeeth no iniquitie in them, Num.</hi> 23.25. <hi>he ſeeth no iniquitie in Iacob.</hi> There is <hi>ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum gibbum, ſive ſphaericum,</hi> a glaſſe made like a round ſphere. 2. <hi>Speculum concavum,</hi> a hollow glaſſe, 3. <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum planum,</hi> a plaine glaſſe. We ſee a thing in a plaine glaſſe, juſt as it is, neither more nor leſſe: we ſee a thing in a hollow glaſſe more then it is, we ſee a thing in a round glaſſe, farre leſſe then it is. When the Lord lookes upon the ſinnes of the wicked, he ſeeth them juſt as they are: when <hi>Sathan</hi> lookes upon the infirmities of the Saints, he ſeeth them more than they are: but when God lookes upon the ſinnes of his Saints, hee ſeeth them leſſe than they are, or not at all: <hi>Ier.</hi> 50 20. <hi>In thoſe dayes and in that time, the iniquitie of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for, and there ſhall be none; and the ſinnes of Iudah, and they ſhall not be found.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>FEare, <hi>is a diſtreſſe and griefe of the ſovle, troubled by the imagination of ſome approaching evill: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a man is threatned without any appearance to bee able to avoyd it eaſily.</hi> It is called <hi>an approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </p>
               <p>There be ſixe ſorts of <hi>feare:</hi> firſt, <hi>naturall,</hi> whereby every thing ſhunnes the deſtruction of it ſelfe; this is in a beaſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>humane,</hi> which ariſeth of too much a deſire to this life; <hi>Iob</hi> 1. <hi>Skin for skin and all that a man hath, will he give for his life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Third, is <hi>worldly,</hi> when a man is affraid for the loſſe of his goods, credit, or ſuch, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. <hi>Many of the rulers beleeved in him, but for feare of the Phariſees they did not confeſſe him, for they loved more the glory of men, than the glory of God;</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. <hi>the fearefull ſhall be caſt out of the holy City,</hi> that is, ſuch fearefull as feare more the loſſe of temporary things, than the loſſe of Gods favour.</p>
               <p>Fourth, <hi>ſervile,</hi> to avoid the puniſhment of ſinne, yet they retaine ſtill the love and liking of ſinne; it is called <hi>ſervile feare</hi> becauſe as the ſervant or hireling workes not for love of his maſter, but onely for feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo the wicked <hi>feare</hi> God for feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but not to love him. This <hi>ſervile feare</hi> is called <hi>Eſaus</hi> feare. So it is called an <hi>adulterous feare,</hi> becauſe, as the adulterous woman is afraid of her husband onely for feare of puniſhment; ſo a man in whom there is ſervile feare, hee feareth God onely for puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Fift, <hi>initiall,</hi> that maketh a man caſt from him the deſire of ſinning by reaſon of the love of God which he hath partly attained unto, and out of the conſideration of the woefull conſequents of ſinne; with the right eye it beholds God, and with the left eye it beholds the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, &amp; as the needle draweth in the threed after it, ſo this <hi>feare draweth</hi> in <hi>charity,</hi> and maketh a way for <hi>filiall feare,</hi> and it is a mids betwixt <hi>ſervile</hi> and <hi>filial
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:173315:124"/>feare:</hi> but it is not ſuch a mids as theſe meanes that mediate betwixt thoſe that are of the ſame kinde, as the middle coulours are betwixt white and blacke, but as that which is imperfect, is a mids betwixt that which is perfect and that which is not.</p>
               <p>Sixt, <hi>filiall feare,</hi> called <hi>timor caſtus,</hi> as the good wife feareth her husband onely out of love and not for feare ſo doth the childe of God. This feare is called <hi>Iſaacks</hi> feare: Theſe make the <hi>feare of the Lord their treaſure, Eſay.</hi> 36.6. Theſe ſorts of <hi>feares,</hi> may be taken up after this ſort, Some ſort of <hi>feare</hi> is, <hi>from the ſpirit and with the ſpirit;</hi> as <hi>initiall</hi> and <hi>filiall feare</hi> are both from the ſpirit of ſanctification, and with the ſpirit of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſome <hi>feare</hi> is, <hi>from the ſpirit, but not with the ſpirit;</hi> as <hi>ſervile feare, Ioſ.</hi> 24. <hi>I will ſend my feare before you.</hi> Gods ſpirit workes this in men: but the ſpirit of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not joyned with it: as the morning is from the Sunne, and yet not with the Sunne. Againe, ſome <hi>feare</hi> is, <hi>with the ſpirit, and not from the ſpirit;</hi> as <hi>naturall feare in man,</hi> for the preſervation of himſelfe: this <hi>feare</hi> is not from the ſpirit of God, and yet it is found. with the Spirit of ſanctification, as in the children of God. Some <hi>feare</hi> is, <hi>neither from the Spirit, nor with the ſpirit,</hi> as, <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>worldly feare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

Filial feare</hi> reſpects firſt ſin and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of God, and in the ſecond roome the puniſhment: but <hi>ſervile feare</hi> reſpects onely the puniſhment:
<note place="margin">Duplex malum paena &amp; culpa.</note> the one of them are the children of the free-woman, the other are but <hi>Hagars</hi> brats, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:173315:125"/>and they hold that in mans converſion it is the ſame <hi>feare</hi> which remaines ſtill, that he had before hee was converted, and it remaines in ſubſtance (ſay they) the ſame <hi>feare,</hi> and is changed onely in act, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it feares not as it did before, the puniſhment one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and theſe two differ (ſay they) <hi>ſecundum ſtatum,</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as that which is imperfect from that which is perfect as a boy differeth from a man. But no <hi>feare</hi> which is <hi>ſervile feare</hi> can ever become a good feare <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>We have not received the ſpirit of feare to bondage, but of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi> it muſt be a new ſort of <hi>feare</hi> then different from this <hi>ſervile feare,</hi> which makes the Children of God ſtand in awe to offend him.</p>

Thirdly, when not onely the inferiour faculties, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſuperiour are troubled: as in the children of God when they are angry againſt ſinne, their zeale ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo diſturbes them, that it hindreth their reaſon for a while, but afterward it growes more cleare again: as when we lay <hi>eye ſalve</hi> to the eyes, the eyes for a while are dimmer, but afterward they ſee more cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſo this zeale although it trouble reaſon for a while, yet afterward it becomes more cleare.

                  <head>The remedies to cure the paſsion of anger.</head>
                  <p>That we may ſettle this paſſion of <hi>anger;</hi> Firſt, we are to conſider the perſons of theſe whom we have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: we muſt give place to wrath, and not <hi>intempeſtivè incendium extinguere,</hi> not to quench the fire unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, for then we rather increaſe the <hi>anger,</hi> when we goe about in time of griefe to pacifie them. So <hi>Iacob</hi> gave place to the anger of his brother <hi>Eſau</hi> for a while, by the counſell of <hi>Rebecca. Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>Primam iram non audebimus oratione mulcere, ſurda eſt &amp; timens, dabimus illi ſpacium, remedia in remiſsionibus morborum proſunt:</hi> that is, <hi>We goe not about to pacifie anger in the heate of it, wee give it leaſure firſt to ſettle, wee cure not feavers in their height, but when they begin to remit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, when others have offended us; that wee may quench our <hi>anger:</hi> Firſt, <hi>Bee angry but ſinne not, Epheſ.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Anger</hi> and ſinne are not two twins, yet they are very like other; as flattery is very like to friendſhip, and can be very hardly diſtinguiſhed from it; for men oftentimes thinke themſelves to bee <hi>angry</hi> for Gods cauſe, when as it is their owne particular that mooves them. The diſciples called for fire from heaven upon the <hi>Samaritans, Luk.</hi> 9.54. one would have thought this to have beene <hi>holy anger</hi> and zeale that moved them for Gods glory, when as it was their own particular which moved them: ſo when the high Prieſt rent his cloathes <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.65. We muſt learne then to diſtinguiſh theſe two, elſe our anger will be but ſinfull <hi>anger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:173315:130"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, Let not the Sun goe downe upon thy wrath: <hi>Anger</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 7.9. <hi>reſts in the boſome of fooles;</hi> it goeth to bed with them, riſeth with them, continueth with them, and goeth oftentimes to the grave with them; the firſt day it may be eaſily cured; the ſecond day more hardly; but the third day moſt hardly: <hi>A threefold cord cannot eaſily bee broken, Eccleſ.</hi> 4.12.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Let reaſon rule thine <hi>anger,</hi> and command it; we ride not firſt, and then bridle our horſe, but firſt we bridle our horſe and then ride: bee not firſt <hi>angry</hi> and then thinke to bridle thy <hi>anger</hi> with reaſon, for then thou wil deceive thy ſelfe; but let reaſon firſt rule, and then be angry.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Remember that thy prayers cannot bee heard unleſſe thou be firſt reconciled to thy neighbour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5 24. <hi>Leave thy gift at the Altar, and be reconciled to him.</hi> So, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. the Apoſtle willeth, <hi>that men lift up holy hands without wrath.</hi> So, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. the man and the wife muſt not jarre, <hi>that their prayers be not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred;</hi> ſo thou canſt not heare the word with profit in <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle willeth us like new borne babes to drinke in the Word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. ſo, wee cannot eat our paſſeover unleſſe the leaven of malice and envy be caſt out, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Let us not celebrate the feaſt with the old leaven of malice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixtly, remember Chriſts example; who when hee was reviled, reviled not againe, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.32. learne to ſpread thy injuries before the Lord as <hi>Ezekias</hi> did when <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> railed againſt him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.14.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Behold oftentimes the paſſion of Chriſt, and that will quench thine <hi>anger.</hi> The Iſraelites when they were ſtung with fiery ſerpents, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. ſo ſoone as they lookt upon the brazen ſerpent, they were healed; ſo when wee are injured and wronged by our
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:173315:130"/>enemies, if we behold the paſſion of Chriſt with faith, it will quench the ſting of our enemies <hi>anger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anger</hi> hath nothing oppoſite to it, as the reſt of the paſſions have, becauſe it riſeth of a preſent evill which we cannot ſhun. If it be preſent and wee may ſhun it, then there needes not a contrary paſſion. When the evill is not preſent, and joyned with difficulty if we may ſurmount it, then ariſeth <hi>courage;</hi> if we cannot ſurmount it, then ariſeth the contrary paſſion <hi>feare.</hi> If the evill be preſent and joyned with difficulty, then ariſeth <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> becauſe we cannot ſhun it; for if we can ſhun it, there can be no paſſion there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But <hi>mildneſſe</hi> ſeemeth contrary to <hi>anger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. Mildneſſe</hi> is not a paſſion but a vertue which moderates it, and is not contrary to it.</p>
                  <p>So much of the image of God in man; in his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, will and affections, wherein eſpecially the image of God conſiſts. Wee come to his outward image of God, which is his dominion over the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

                  </label> and herein he reſembled his Maker.</p>
               <p>There is no creature that can uſe all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures but man; Firſt,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Illuſt. </seg>1</label> hee had dominion over the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible creatures, as the elements, for no creature can uſe the fire but man; he can doe ſundry things with the fire that no creature can doe; which argueth that hee was made Lord over it. The Lyon who is the King
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:173315:131"/>of beaſts, is afraid of the fire, and when hee ſeeth the light of it, he fleeth from it. 2. He had commandement over the living creatures, for as yet a little boy can leade a great Elephant, and a childe will drive a number of oxen before him; the relicts of Gods image in man makes them ſtand in awe of him yet.</p>
               <p>There are ſundry creatures that excell man in ſome things;
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Illuſt. </seg>2</label> as ſome excell him in ſmell, ſome in ſight, and ſome in touch; but joyne them all together in man, hee excelleth them all: which ſheweth that man was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Lord over the creatures.</p>
               <p>Reaſon is onely found in man,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Illuſt. </seg>3</label> by the which hee can ſubdue all the perturbations in beaſts, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.7. <hi>All are tamed by man;</hi> which they cannot doe by themſelves: that ſheweth that man was made Lord over them.</p>
               <p>We count that one of the moſt excellent qualities in beaſts,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Illuſt. </seg>4</label> when they can counterfeit man neereſt; as the Elephant his reaſon; the birds his words; the Ape his geſtures; which all ſhew that he was made Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them.</p>
               <p>That which hath a ſhew of reaſon,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Illuſt. </seg>5</label> 
                  <hi>&amp; diminute</hi> in part onely, ſhould obey him who hath reaſon perfectly, and underſtanding of all things: but beaſts have onely ſome ſhew of reaſon, they know ſome particular things, but they have not a full and an univerſall knowledge of things, therefore they are naturally ſubject to man.</p>
               <p>There is nothing ſwifter than the horſe among beaſts, and yet he carries man, the dogge though moſt fierce waits upon man; the Elephant for as great and terrible as he is, yet he ſerves to be a ſport to man, in publike meetings he learnes to leap, kneele and dance; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beaſts ſerve to feed man: we eate the honey of the bees, we drinke the milke of cattell, therefore all the beaſts are made ſubject to man.</p>
               <p>Man was Lord over the creatures before the fall,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:173315:131"/>and they were ready to obey him, hence may be drawn theſe conſequents.</p>
               <p>It is lawfull for men to hunt after the beaſts and to catch them now,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ariſtl. pol.</hi> 1. <hi>o.</hi> 5.</note> becauſe that way he recovers the right over them again, that he had at the beginning.</p>
               <p>Man was Lord over the creatures before the fall: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could be afraid of none of them: we ſee that <hi>Eva</hi> was not afraid of the ſerpent, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was when he fled from it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Man hath another ſort of dominion over the living creatures, than that which he hath over the plants and herbs of the fields: for the dominion which he had over the living creatures was <hi>per imperium rationis,</hi> but he had dominion over the plants, <hi>per ſolum earum uſum,</hi> onely by uſing them.</p>
               <p>Man was made Lord over the creatures, therfore when by ſinne he becomes a beaſt, like a dog or a hog; how farre then doth he abaſe himſelfe from his firſt eſtate and dominion: <hi>Plato</hi> called this, <hi>Foedam animarum incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porationem,</hi> which ſome miſtaking, thought that he held that the ſoules of men entred into beaſts, but he meant onely that men became brutiſh and ſenſuall like beaſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How were the beaſts ſo farre diſtant from <hi>Adam</hi> gathered unto him, and how could they give homage to him, being ſo farre from him?
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen,</hi> 9. <hi>ad liter. cap.</hi> 4</note> 
                  <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> holds that when the beaſts were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before man, that it was not by the authority which man had over them being ſo farre diſtant from him: but by the miniſtery of the Angels, or by the immediate power of God, as they were gathered in the Arke to <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 7.8.9. This ſeemes moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
               <p>Before the fall the beaſts were ſubiect unto man:
<note place="margin">A collation betwixt the innocent and old <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> but ſince the fall he hath loſt his dominion; they become
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:173315:132"/>enemies unto him, they picke out his eyes, eate his fleſh, lappe his bloud. Before the fall Gods image made them ſtand in awe of him. Man ſtands in awe of the Kings he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald, becauſe of his coate of armes, take off this coat of armes from him, and men carry no reſpect to him: The image of God is as it were the Lords coate of armes, which he put upon him, that made the creatures af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of him. We have a notable example of this in the primitive Church,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 8,</note> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> teſtifieth, when the Chriſtians were caſt naked to the wilde beaſts: yee ſhould have ſeene them ſtamping, raging, and ſtaring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, but durſt not ſet upon them, the image of God ſo affrayed them: therefore the perſecutors cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them with the skinnes of wilde beaſts, to make them run upon them.</p>
               <p>Chriſt when he was in the wilderneſſe with the beaſts forty dayes and forty nights,
<note place="margin">A collation betwixt the ſecond, renewed, and old <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> they hurt him not, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. So when the image of God is reſtored to man in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, they begin willingly to ſerve him: but they are enemies to the unregenerate. The dogges that eate the fleſh of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 9.35. yet they licke the ſores of <hi>Lazarus, Luk.</hi> 16.21. The ravens that picke out the eyes of theſe who are diſobedient to their parents, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.17. yet they feed <hi>Elias</hi> in the wilderneſſe, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 17.4.6 The ſerpents ſting the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe, <hi>Num.</hi> 21.6. yet the Viper when it leaps upon <hi>Pauls</hi> hand hurts him not, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.3, 5. The fiſh eate the bodies of the wicked in the ſea: yet the Whale preſerved <hi>Ionas, Ion.</hi> 1.17. The Lyons that touch not <hi>Daniel:</hi> yet devour his accuſers, <hi>Daniel</hi> 6.17. It is true that there are ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts of the image of God left, which make the beaſts to ſtand in awe of him: therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. it is ſaid, <hi>When men goe to reſt, then the beasts come forth to hunt for their prey.</hi> But theſe remnants of the image of God in the unregenerate, doe not ſo terrifie the beaſts, as the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:173315:132"/>image of God reſtored in the regenerate man doth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What benefit ſhould <hi>Adam</hi> have had of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures before the fall: for he had not neede of them <hi>ad alimentum</hi> for nouriſhment: he had not neede of them <hi>ad indumentum</hi> for cloathing: he had not need of them <hi>ad laboris adiumentum,</hi> to helpe him to labour in his worke, as we have now?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> He had other uſes of them, for they were the matter of the praiſing of God. We ſee now when Kings and Princes kepe Lyons, Eagles, Bears, Tigers, and ſuch their ſubiects gather their greatneſſe by this, and their ſoveraingty: much more did <hi>Adam</hi> before the fal gather the greatneſſe and excellency of God, by the diverſity of theſe creatures. Againe, by them he ſhould have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more experimentall knowledge of the qualities of the creatures: therefore it is ſaid, <hi>that God brought them before Adam that hee might ſee how he would call them, Gen.</hi> 2.20.</p>
               <p>As hee was Lord over the beaſts before the fall,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Prop. </seg>
                  </label> and they were peaceably ſubiect to him: ſo they were peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able amongſt themſelves, and one of them devoured not another.</p>
               <p>Wee ſee when the beaſts were in the Arke, after the fall, the ravening beaſts lived not upon fleſh,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Illuſt. </seg>
                  </label> but they agreed all together: which vively repreſents to us the firſt eſtate and condition of the creatures. And as it ſerveth for the credit of a Maſter of a familie, that not onely his ſervants obey him, but alſo that they agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſeves: So the creatures not onely obeyed man before his fall, but alſo in feare of their Lord they agreed amongſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>As man had dominion over the brutiſh creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fall,

               <p>Mans eſtate before the fall was no better than the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of the Angels but amongſt the Angels ſome are ſuperiour and ſome inferiour,

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Had Chriſt nothing in propriety to himſelfe, had hee but onely the naked uſe of things?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are ſundry ſorts of rights. Firſt, that which many have right to in common, as the Levites in Iſrael had right in common to the tythes: but <hi>Barnabas</hi> a Levite who dwelt in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> out of <hi>Iudea</hi> had his poſſeſſions proper to himſelfe, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. So the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> had their goods in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is, <hi>uſus juris et uſus facti:</hi> the uſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, &amp; the naked uſe of things: the <hi>naked uſe</hi> is, when a man hath onely the naked uſe,
<note place="margin">Duplex uſus, iuris, &amp; facti.</note> that he may neither ſell it, nor give it to others: the <hi>uſe of propriety</hi> is, when he may both uſe it himſelfe and give the uſe of it to others,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:173315:135"/>When a man hires a houſe, then hee hath onely the <hi>bare uſe</hi> of it, becauſe hee cannot let it out to another, but when he hath a Leaſe of it, then he hath <hi>uſum juris,</hi> and may then let it to another.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Duplex jus, charitatis, &amp; proprietatis.</note> there is a <hi>right of charity</hi> and a <hi>right of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty:</hi> a man comming into a vineyard, he may eate as many of the grapes as he pleaſeth to ſatisfie his hunger, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.24. this is the <hi>right of charity:</hi> but hee may carry none away with him; this is the <hi>right of property.</hi> So the Diſciples when they were hungry upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <hi>pulled the eares of corne, Matth.</hi> 12.2. This was the <hi>right of charity,</hi> but they carried none away with them, becauſe they had not the <hi>right of property;</hi> and in this ſenſe it is that <hi>Salomon, Prov.</hi> 3.27. calls the poore <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnale tobh,</hi> the Lords of thy goods: <hi>withhold not thy goods from the owners thereof,</hi> that is, from the poore; the poore in their neceſſity have the uſe of thy goods. That axiome is true then, <hi>Ius charitatis manet ſemper, ſed non pro ſemper, habent enim jus utendi, non pro omni tempore ſed tempore neceſsitatis;</hi> that is, Charity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth alwayes, but we are not at all times to give our goods; there is a time to give them, not all times, but in the time of neceſſity; and in this ſenſe is that of <hi>Luke</hi> to be underſtood, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.30. <hi>Give to every one that askes of you;</hi> that is, who in extreame neceſſity askes of you.</p>
               <p>Chriſt had not <hi>jus in communi,</hi> with the Diſciples,
<note place="margin">Of the right that Chriſt as man had to the creatures.</note> in the bagge, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. For theſe that have a <hi>common right,</hi> one of them cannot give without the conſent of the reſt; but Chriſt had a <hi>proper right</hi> to the bagge, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Iudas</hi> to uſe it for the benefit of the poore, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.29.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt had not a bare &amp; a <hi>naked uſe</hi> of things, but alſo he had the <hi>uſe of property</hi> in ſome things, as the clothes which he wore, and the money which he ſpent;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:173315:136"/>he had not onely the <hi>naked uſe</hi> to weare them, but alſo the <hi>property</hi> of them, for he might have given them to others: it is true, he had but <hi>nudum uſum</hi> of the houſe which he dwelt in, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.58. <hi>The Foxes have holes, but the Sonne of man, hath not a hole wherein to hide his head,</hi> for he had not the property of any houſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he had not onely <hi>jus charitatis</hi> to things, but alſo the <hi>right of property;</hi> neither had he theſe things as almes, for that which a man laboureth for is not called almes, <hi>ſol us titulus recipiendi, ratione naturalis neceſsita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis facit mendicum,</hi> the onely title of receiving in reſpect of naturall neceſſity, makes a begger: when it is ſought and given in this manner, then it is almes.</p>
               <p>Now that the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> had not his maintenance given him, by way of almes, it is proved thus; firſt <hi>he had the ends of the earth given him for a poſſeſsion, Pſal.</hi> 2. and <hi>all things were put under his feet, Pſal.</hi> 8. he <hi>ſent for the mans colt, Luk.</hi> 19.30. Which ſheweth that he had right over all the creatures.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is proved thus, <hi>If wee ſow to you ſpirituall things, ought yee not to give us temporall things?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11. but Ieſus Chriſt ſowed ſpirituall things to them, therefore temporall things were his by right of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is ſaid, <hi>Who feedes the flocke and eates not of the milke of it?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. as the ſhepheard and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier have the right of property to their wages, ſo had Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt ſaith <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. <hi>Goe into whatſoever houſe yee come to, and eate that which is ſet before you:</hi> the Diſciples had not onely <hi>jus gratitudinis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Duplex jus gratitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, &amp; juris.</note> the right of thankfulneſſe; but alſo <hi>jus juris,</hi> the right of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Chriſt had this right ſeeing he preached the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. When <hi>Paul</hi> tooke no ſtipend from the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.8. <hi>receſsit à jure ſuo,</hi> hee went from his
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:173315:136"/>right: therefore others had this right of property, and ſo had Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But Chriſt willed his Diſciples to leave all for his cauſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.37. and he ſet himſelfe as an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before them of poverty: therefore he did renounce all right of things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Duplex abnegatio reru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in affectu, &amp; in effectu.</note> Wee renounce all things two wayes either in our <hi>affection,</hi> or in <hi>deed:</hi> they renounced all in <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> but not in <hi>deed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, there are two ſorts of poverty; <hi>materiall</hi> poverty, and <hi>formall</hi> poverty. Chriſt left all things both moveable and immoveable in his affection, <hi>formally:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Duplex paupert as: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialis, &amp; formalis.</note> but not <hi>materially: formall</hi> poverty is this, when in our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction we are ready to renounce all for Chriſt; but <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall</hi> poverty is, when we are actually called to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. Mark.</hi> 10.21. Chriſt commanded the young man, <hi>to ſell all and follow him, if hee would be perfect:</hi> therefore it may ſeeme that <hi>materiall</hi> poverty, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him that would be moſt abſolutely perfect, and that Chriſt made choyce of this ſort of poverty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt theſe two; firſt, to leave all, and to follow Chriſt: Secondly, that hee who truſts in his riches ſhould ſell all,
<note place="margin">Prior ut ſcholaſtict lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur, facta eſt ad rem, poſterior ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, non ſimplex.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt part of this ſpeech belongs to the matter it ſelfe, and the ſecond to the perſon: the firſt is common to all, becauſe all are bound to leaue all for Chriſt in affection; but the ſecond part belongs onely to this young man, who was ſo well conceited of himſelfe, truſting in his riches, that he ſhould ſell all, and ſhould give of that which hee ſold to the poore: not that hee ſhould give all to the poore when he ſold it, but give of that which he ſold to the poore; <hi>non dare omnia, ſed de omnibus,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9.</p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:173315:137"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why bids he him ſell all?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he had ſuch confidence in his riches, for they hindered him from following of Chriſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee bids him quite all actually; which precept binds not others, it being particular to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But Chriſt ſayes, <hi>if thou wilt bee perfect, goe and ſell all,</hi> then this ſeemes to be the pitch of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to renounce all: and is more than that which the law requires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt ſpeakes not here of any perfection, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the perfection of the Law; but of true perfection which is above imaginary perfection: as if hee ſhould ſay: thou imagineſt thou art perfect, and thinkeſt that thou haſt kept the whole Law, if it be ſo, yet one thing is reſting to thee, <hi>ſell all:</hi> thus wee ſee how Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies himſelfe to his conceit here.</p>
               <p>

               </head>
               <p>THe ſecond conſequent of the image of God being placed in man, is, concerning the nature of it.</p>
               <p>There are two things which principally wee and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> controvert about, touching the image of God. The firſt is, <hi>conditio naturae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Duplex conditio imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Dei, naturae, &amp; Iustitiae.</note> the condition of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the ſecond is, <hi>condtio juſtitiae,</hi> concernig mans righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds, that there was concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in in the nature of man, being created in his pure-<hi>naturalls,</hi> but it was not a ſinne (ſay they) or a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin as it is now, but a defect following the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of nature;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap,</hi> 28.</note> and they ſay that it was not from God but beſides his intention. And they goe about to cleare the matter by this compariſon: when a Smith makes a ſword of yron, he is not the cauſe of the ruſt in the y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, but ruſt followeth as a conſequent in the yron: but if this rebellion flow from the condition of nature, how can God be free from the cauſe of ſin, who is the author of nature?</p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:173315:139"/>
               <p>Their compariſon then taken from the Smith and the iron is altogether impertinent:
<note place="margin">Triplex diſsimilitudo compparation is.</note> firſt, the ſmith made not the yron, as God made man, therefore he cannot bee ſayd to be the cauſe of the ruſt of yron, as God making man, concupiſcence neceſſarily followes him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their poſition.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ruſt doth not neceſſarily follow the yron, neither is the yron the cauſe of it, but ſome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things: they make concupiſcence neceſſary to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the body.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Smith if he could, he would make ſuch a ſword that ſhould take no ruſt; but God (according to their judgement) made man ſuch that concupiſcence did neceſſarily follow.</p>
               <p>Before the fall there was no reluctation nor ſtrife betwixt the ſuperiour and inferiour faculties in man;
<note place="margin">That there was no concupiſcence in man before the fall.</note> and therefore no concupiſcence: our reaſons are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, our firſt parents were not aſhamed when they were naked, <hi>Gen</hi> 2. but after that <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned and ſaw himſelfe naked, hee fled from the preſence of God and hid himſelfe even for very ſhame; it is the rebellion betwixt the ſuperiour and inferiour faculties that makes men aſhamed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in Ieſus Chriſt the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> there was no rebellion, and yet he was like to us in all things ſinne excepted, taking our nature upon him, and the eſſentiall properties of it. As to bee tempted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Ieſus was carried by the Spirit into the deſert to bee tempted;</hi> So to feare, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.7. <hi>he was heard in that which hee feared.</hi> So to be angry, <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Hee looked round about on them angerly:</hi> So forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his office by reaſon of the agonie aſtoniſhing his ſenſes; <hi>Father, if it bee poſsible, let this cup paſſe from me, Mat.</hi> 26.39. Wherefore if this ſtrife, betwixt the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:173315:139"/>ſuperiour and inferiour faculties, was the conſequent of nature in our whole eſtate, then Chriſt ſhould not have beene blameleſſe, which is blaſphemy: for <hi>concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence is ſin, Rom,</hi> 7.7.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if there had been rebellion, betwixt the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour</hi> and <hi>inferiour faculties</hi> before the fall; then man in his whole eſtate had not beene happy for <hi>Paul</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this concupiſcence, is forced to cry out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver mee from this body of death?</hi> and originall iuſtice had not beene ſuch an excellent gift in that eſtate, but only a reſtraint, to reſtraine this concupiſcence that it burſted not forth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if this rebellion flow from nature, how can God be free from ſinne who is the authour of nature? <hi>qui eſt cauſa cauſae, eſt cauſa cauſati, in eſſentialiter ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatis,</hi> he who is the cauſe of a cauſe, is likewiſe the cauſe of the effect in things eſſentially ſubordinate: but God is the author of mans nature and concupiſcence: therefore according to their poſition,
<note place="margin">Of mans originall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, according to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </note> he muſt bee the author of ſinne: this is blaſphemie.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds, that this <hi>holineſſe</hi> was a <hi>ſupernaturall</hi> thing to man, and not naturall in his firſt creation: and they goe about to ſhew the matter by theſe compariſons.</p>
               <p>They ſay, mans righteouſneſſe in his innocent eſtate, was like a garland ſet upon a virgines head; the garland is no part of the virgins body, and although the garland be removed, yet ſhe remaines ſtill a virgin. So this <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall righteouſneſſe,</hi> they make it as it were a garland, which being taken away from man, no naturall thing is blemiſhed in him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they compare it to <hi>Sampſons</hi> lockes, which when they were cut off, nothing was taken from <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> nature.</p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:173315:140"/>
               <p>Thirdly, they compare it to a bridle in a horſe mouth, which is no part of the horſe, nor naturall to him, but ſerves to bridle the horſe and keepe him in. So ſay they, this originall <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> was no naturall thing in man before the fall, but ſerved onely as a bridle to reſtraine concupiſcence; and they put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a naked man and a robbed man.
<note place="margin">Duplex homo, nudus &amp; ſpoliatus.</note> Man before his fall (ſay they) he was naked, but God did caſt his cloake of <hi>ſupernaturall righteouſneſſe</hi> about him to cover him: but ſince the fall (ſay they) hee is not <hi>homo nudus ſed ſpoliatus,</hi> a naked man, but ſpoyled of the graces of God.</p>
               <p>Hence is that diviſion made by the Ieſuites of the eſtate of man:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Perer. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>in Gen. diſput. de excellent. pag.</hi> 118.</note> the firſt eſtate (ſaith he) is of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered without grace or ſinne, (as they terme it) in his <hi>pure naturals;</hi> the ſecond eſtate is of man in his <hi>purena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals,</hi> cloathed with ſupernaturall righteouſnes: the third eſtate is of man <hi>degenerate</hi> and ſinfull: the fourth eſtate, is of man <hi>regenerate;</hi> and the laſt is of man <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> But to conſider a man both voyde of grace and ſinne, ſuch a man was never, nor never ſhall be; neither did the Iewiſh or Chriſtian Church, ever divide the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of man thus.</p>
               <p>The Iewiſh Church taketh up the eſtate of man in theſe three; the firſt they call <hi>Adam, ratioue creationis,</hi> becauſe hee was made out of the red earth: the ſecond they call <hi>Enoſh,</hi> man ſubject to all miſeries: the third they call <hi>Iſh,</hi> man reſtored to bleſſedneſſe and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>The orthodoxe chriſtian Church, divides the eſtate of man thus: the firſt eſtate, is <hi>gratiae collatio,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of grace: the ſecond is, <hi>collatae amiſsio</hi> the loſſe of that grace beſtowed: the third is, <hi>inſtauratio amiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae,</hi> the reſtoring of loſt grace; and the fourth is, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatio inſtauratae,</hi> the confirmation of reſtored grace.</p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:173315:140"/>
               <p>We will ſhew that his <hi>originall righteouſneſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of mans originall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, according to the reformed Church.</note> was <hi>naturall</hi> to man, and not ſupernaturall: where we muſt conſider: that nature is take five wayes:</p>
               <p>Firſt, a thing is <hi>naturall</hi> by creation, as the ſoule and the body are <hi>naturall</hi> to man, becauſe they give a being to him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for that which floweth eſſentially and naturally from a thing, as the faculties from the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for that which cleaveth moſt ſurely to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as ſinne doth to the ſoule now.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, for that which beautifieth nature and helps it, as grace doth.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, for that which by generation is propagate to the poſteritie, as originall corruption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Originall juſtice</hi> was not naturall to man in the firſt ſenſe, for it was no part of his eſſence. It was not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to him in the ſecond ſenſe, for it flowed not from the underſtanding eſſentially, as the faculties of the ſoule doe; but it was naturall to him in the third ſenſe, becauſe hee was created in holineſſe, and was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of holineſſe: it was naturall to him in the fourth ſenſe, becauſe it made his nature perfect: It was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to him in the fift ſenſe, for he ſhould have tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to his poſteritie by generation, if he had ſtood in holineſſe, as man doth ſinne now, which is come in place of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Originall righteouſneſſe</hi> to the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, to the renewed <hi>Adam, grace</hi> is <hi>ſupernaturall;</hi>

                  </note> to the old <hi>Adam,</hi> it is againſt his nature, ſo long as hee continues in ſinne.</p>
               <p>Our reaſons proving, that <hi>originall righteouſneſſe,</hi> was <hi>naturall</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> and not <hi>ſupernaturall,</hi> are theſe.</p>

               <p>But we muſt hold for our part, this to be the ground

               <p>Thirdly, that the corruption of nature conſiſts not in any corrupt qualitie, but onely in the loſſe of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall grace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that death is not an effect of ſinne proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but it is from nature, and it is onely accidentally from ſin; becauſe ſin removes that bridle of originall righteouſneſſe, which held backe death.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that concupiſcence is not ſinne in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>

The Philoſophers were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the nature of man in his whole eſtate, ſo were they ignorant of his fall; and therefore they tooke up man in a middle eſtate. So theſe Sophiſts following the Philoſophers, and not the Scriptures, as though they had never heard of mans creation, nor yet of his fall; imagine him to be a middle ſort of man, ſuch a man as never was, neither in his whole eſtate, nor after his fall: but they ought to have remembred that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Take heed lest any ſpoyle you by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie.</hi>

                  </label> that hee ſhall bee like the Angels of God, and bee loved of them, as they love one another. So it was mans great happineſſe before the fall, that hee conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the Angels, and they loved him.</p>
               <p>The Angels did neither miniſter unto,
<note place="margin">A collation betwixt the innocent, ſecond, renewed, and old <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> nor keepe the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> before his fall, they onely loved him. The Angels miniſtred to Chriſt the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> and loved him, but did not keepe him. The Angels miniſter now to the <hi>renewed Adam,</hi> they love him and keepe him; but
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:173315:142"/>they neither miniſter to the wicked, love them, nor keepe them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Angels neither did miniſter to <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, nor did they keepe him, becauſe hee was in no danger, onely they loved him: they miniſtred to Ieſus Chriſt, but they did not keep him, for he was <hi>comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> as well as <hi>viator.</hi> Chriſt is the head of the Angels, therefore hee is not kept by them: but they miniſter to the elect, and keepe them by Chriſt; which priviledge <hi>Adam</hi> had not of them before his fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It may ſeeme that they did keepe Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. <hi>they ſhall keepe thee in all thy wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is to be underſtood <hi>de Chriſto myſtico,</hi> of Chriſt in his members; that is, they ſhall keepe thy members in all their wayes. But this part of the <hi>Pſalme</hi> was miſapplyed by the Divell to Chriſt in proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. for the Angels keepe not Chriſt, but miniſter to him: but they both keepe and miniſter to his members the elect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be ſayd, that the elect have grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter priviledges then, than Chriſt hath, ſeeing they both keepe them, and miniſter to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This argueth not any prerogative that the Saints have above Chriſt, but onely their weakeneſſe and wants, that they have need of the Angels to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, as young children ſtand in need of nurſes to waite upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It may ſeeme that Angels are not miniſtring ſpirits in reſpect of the elect, but in reſpect of Chriſt; becauſe the Angell, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.22. calls himſelfe, not our ſervant, but, <hi>our fellow ſervant.</hi> So the Angels are not called the ſervants of the kingdomes, but, <hi>The Princes of the Kingdomes, Dan.</hi> 12. Thirdly, the Apoſtle proves Chriſt to be God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. becauſe the Angels are ſervants to him. A ſhepheard is not the ſervant of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:173315:143"/>his ſheepe, although hee keepes them; but his Maſters ſervant. So although the Angels keepe us, yet they ſeeme not to be our miniſters but Chriſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. calls them miniſtring ſpirits, ſent for them that are elect; and although they be more excellent creatures in themſelves, than the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; yet in Chriſt, and by Chriſt, they become mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſpirits to us. Chriſt himſelfe is not aſhamed to call himſelfe a ſervant to the elect, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. <hi>I came not to bee ſerved, but to ſerve:</hi> why may not then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels be ſayd, to be miniſters to the elect?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It is a Maxime in Phyloſophy, that the end is more excellent than the meanes tending to the end: but the ſafety of man is the end: and the Angels are the meanes, therefore it may ſeeme that man is more excellent than the Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The end conſidered as the end, is alwayes more excellent than the meanes tending to the end, but not abſolutely, touching the eſſence of the meanes; for theſe things that are the meanes may be more excellent in themſelves. Example: The incarnation of Chriſt is more excellent than the redemption of man in it ſelfe, and yet it is inſtitute for another end; ſo the Sun, Moon, and ſtarres were inſtitute to give influence to the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our bodies, herbes, trees and plants, and yet they are more excellent in themſelves; but conſider them as meanes tending to that end, they are inferiour to them.</p>
               <p>The Angels neither love the wicked, nor miniſter to them, nor preſerve them. But here we muſt marke, when we ſay they miniſter not to them, this is to bee underſtood of their ſpeciall and particular miniſtring, they attend them not, as they doe the elect; it is true, as God makes his Sunne to ſhine as well upon the unjuſt as the juſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.45. ſo the Angels may be miniſters ſometimes of outward things even to the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:173315:143"/>wicked. Whoſoever ſtept downe firſt into the poole of <hi>Siloam, Ioh.</hi> 5.8. was cured whether good or bad: and the Angels brought downe <hi>Manna</hi> in the wilderneſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.25. to the bad Iſraelites, as well as to the good: but they have not a particular care of the wicked as they have of the elect of God; they come not up and downe upon the Ladder, Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.52. to miniſter to them as they doe to the elect.</p>

                  </label> which lighting upon tranſparent bodies they caſt a brightneſſe or ſplendor by their reflex; and after their reflex, they caſt ſhadowes. So from God that glorious Sunne, there proceeded firſt wiſedome, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexed upon the mind of <hi>Adam</hi> to cognoſce and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template upon things; this contemplation, brought forth prudency, and at laſt arts, as the ſhadow of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.

                  <note place="margin">Vita activa eſt prior in via generation is, ſed vita contemplativa eſt prior in via directionis.</note> It may bee asked which of theſe two lives is to be preferred before another: it might ſeeme that <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deney</hi> is to bee preferred before <hi>wiſdome;</hi> for man is bound to love God above all, and to helpe his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; theſe we get not by <hi>contemplation</hi> but by <hi>action.</hi> Againe, it may ſeeme that the <hi>contemplative life</hi> is the beſt life, becauſe in the <hi>active life</hi> there are many dangers and perils, but not ſo in the <hi>contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To cleare this point, wee muſt marke theſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when we compare theſe two <hi>wiſedome</hi> and <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> together,
<note place="margin">Duplex bonitas; neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitatis, &amp; excellentiae.</note> either we reſpect the neceſſity of them, or the excellency of them. If wee reſpect the <hi>neceſsity</hi> of them; then no doubt, <hi>prudency</hi> is moſt fit for oure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate now.</p>
               <p>If wee marke the <hi>excellency</hi> of them, then wee muſt uſe this diſtinction; one thing is ſaid to be better than another, either abſolutely, or determinate to this or that particular: as, to have foure feet is good for a horſe, but not abſolutely good,
<note place="margin">Duplex bonitas; abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luta &amp; determinata.</note> for it is not good for a man. So to be a Philoſopher is determinately good for man, but not abſolutely good; for it is not good for a horſe. So <hi>wiſedome</hi> and <hi>prudency</hi> conferred together, <hi>wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> abſolutely is better than <hi>prudency;</hi> but <hi>prudency</hi> in this caſe as we are now, is better for us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Duplex couſideratio vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae humanae, reſpectu mediorum, &amp; fin is.</note> if wee conſider the end of mans life; then <hi>contemplation</hi> is better than action; but if wee conſider the meanes tending to the end, then action is fitter for us, than <hi>contemplation.</hi> If wee conſider the end, it is more excellent than the meanes; for all theſe practicall arts and operations which man doth, are ordained (as to their properend,) to the <hi>contemplation</hi> of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: and all the <hi>contemplation</hi> of the underſtanding is ordained for the metaphyſickes: and all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

               <p>Theſe two ſorts of lives, are ſo neceſſary both for this life, and for the life to come, and are ſo ſtraitly lincked, that we muſt labour to joyne them together.</p>
               <p>The <hi>active life,</hi> without the <hi>contemplative life,</hi>

                  </label> is a moſt imperfect life, like the fruit pulled from the tree; ſo the <hi>contemplative life,</hi> without the <hi>active,</hi> is a moſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect life; but joyne them both together, they make a perfect <hi>Argus,</hi> having his eyes looking up and downe.</p>
               <p>Theſe two ſorts of lives are well compared to the two great lights in heaven, the Sun and Moone: firſt, as the Moone hath her light from the Sunne, ſo hath <hi>pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> her light from <hi>wiſedome.</hi> Secondly, as the Sunne rules the day, and the Moone the night; ſo <hi>wiſedome</hi> rules our heavenly life; and <hi>prudency</hi> our earthly life.

               <p>When <hi>Elias</hi> was in the wilderneſſe, the Angel came to him and ſaid; what doſt thou here? So the Lord will ſay one day to theſe unprofitable members (that are in the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:173315:145"/>Church and Common-wealth) what do ye in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe; The Philoſopher could ſay, that hee was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a God or a beaſt that could live in the Wilderneſſe; this their <hi>contemplative life</hi> hath pride for the father, and idleneſſe for the mother.</p>
               <p>The <hi>contemplative life,</hi> is the moſt excellent life, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that life that drawes neereſt to it, muſt be the beſt. There are three ſorts of lifes,
<note place="margin">Triplex vita, activa, effectiva, &amp; voluptua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</note> the <hi>active</hi> life, the <hi>effective</hi> life, and the <hi>voluptuary.</hi> The <hi>active</hi> life conſiſts in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging and ruling things by prudency; this was <hi>Davids</hi> life, and it comes neereſt to the contemplative life. The <hi>effective</hi> life conſiſts in dreſſing of the ground, in huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, and ſuch; this was <hi>Vzziahs</hi> life: therefore, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15. He is called <hi>vir agri,</hi> becauſe he delighted in tillage; and this is further removed from the <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative life,</hi> than the <hi>active life.</hi> The voluptuary life was that in <hi>Salomon,</hi> when he gave himſelfe to pleaſure and delights, ſo the life of <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> and this is furtheſt from the <hi>contemplative life. Adam</hi> had the <hi>contemplative life</hi> chiefly, he had the <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>effective life;</hi> but he had not that <hi>voluptuary</hi> or ſinfull life, delighting in pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt Adam</hi> his life was <hi>contemplative,

               <p>The third condition makes him an abſolute man, and then he is called the <hi>little world,</hi> or <hi>epilogus mundi,</hi> the compend of the world; and ſo hee ſhould labour to keepe all things in a juſt frame.</p>
               <p>The fourth condition, as he is ayming towards his end, and ſo he is compared to a <hi>ſhippe</hi> in the midſt of the Sea, ſayling towards the haven; reaſon is the ſhip; the windes, waves, and rockes, are the many hazards we are expoſed to in this life; the oares are his affections and deſires; and when the eye is ſet upon eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, this is like the pole which directs the ſhip.</p>
               <p>The fift condition is then, when as the ſoule is puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:173315:146"/>by vertue, and elevated above the owne nature, then it is compared to a <hi>chariot,</hi> which reſembles the whole conſtitution of the ſoule joyned to the body; the Coach-man is reaſon; the horſes which draw the coach are two, one white and another blacke; the white horſe is the iraſcible appetite, the blacke is the concupiſcible appetite; the ſpurres which ſpurre theſe horſes forward, are, deſire of honour, and feare of ſhame.</p>
               <p>The ſixt condition is, when the ſoule by contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aſcends to God, then it is compared to a <hi>fowle</hi> mounting upward, then it is no longer conſidered as yoaked in the coach, for now the horſes are looſed, <hi>&amp; auriga ſiſtens eos ad praeſepe, tribuit eis nectar &amp; ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam;</hi> that is, <hi>the coachman looſing the horſes, brings them to the manger, and gives them nectar and ambroſia to eate and drinke;</hi> for when the ſoule is taken up with this contemplation, beholding the chiefe Good, then the appetite is ſatisfied with milke and honey as the Scripture calls it. As nurſes taking pleaſure and delight to feed their babes, when they have ſtilled them, they lay them up to ſleepe, and then they take delight to feed themſelves: ſo, when the ſenſible faculty ſhall be ſatisfied, then ſhall our great delight be in contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to behold the face of God and that eternall glory: whereupon is reſolved that poſition laid downe in the beginning, that mans chiefe felicity in his life before the fall, was chiefly in contemplation, and ſo ſhall it be in glory: although action in love doe flow from it, as the fruit from the tree.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XX. <hi>Of Adams conjunct life, or his marriage.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe ſecond royall prerogative beſtowed upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> in Paradiſe, was, that he had his marriage im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately celebrated by God.</p>
               <p>God made the woman of the man. Hee made not paires of males and females in mankinde, as hee did of the reſt of living creatures; but he made the one of the other, firſt to ſhew them the neere conjunction which is betwixt them; ſecondly, hee made the woman of the man, that he might be her heed, and the fountaine of all man-kinde, which chiefly belonged to his dignity: thirdly, ſhe was made of him, that ſhe might obey and honour him; Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mark.</hi> 2.27. the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath; therefore as man was made Lord over the Sabbath, ſo hee was made Lord over the woman.</p>
               <p>This ſubjection of the woman to the man, was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the veile which was put upon the womans head when ſhe was married, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.65. In the <hi>fift of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> when the husband accuſed the wife of adultery ſhe was commanded to ſtand bareheaded before the Prieſt, as not being now under her husbands ſubjection, untill ſhe was cleared of this blot.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this ſubjection is notably ſet out in that heavenly order, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. <hi>God is Chriſts head, and Chriſt is the mans head, and the man is the womans head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, this ſubjection is likewiſe ſhewed by that dreame of <hi>Ioſeph, Gen.</hi> 37. Where the father is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Sunne, the wife to the Moone, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the ſtarres.</p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:173315:147"/>
               <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Perſians</hi> had this ſoveraignty over their wives, they had a proverbiall kind of ſpeech which was, <hi>and they ſhall ſpeake the language of their owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> that is, they ſhall live after the manner of their owne country, and have commandement over their wives, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 1.20. <hi>vejit tenu jecar,</hi> they put her in the maſculine gender, to ſignifie their ready obedience; for when the Hebrewes will commend a thing in women as well done, they put them in the maſculine gender: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, when they will diſcommend men, they put them in the feminine gender; becauſe now they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted abomination with idols.</p>
               <p>Since the fall,
<note place="margin">A collation betwixt the innocent, and old <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> this heavenly order is mightily inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when the woman claymes ſoveraignty over the man, and will not bee ſubject to him: as ſhe ſeekes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over her husband; ſo if ſhe could, ſhe would pull Chriſt out of his place, and God the Father out of his.</p>
               <p>This inverting of natures order, hath ever a curſe joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with it, when ſuch effect ſuperiority. <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath a very good apologue for this: the members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Serpent (ſaith hee) fell at variance among themſelves; the taile complained that the head had alwayes the governement, and deſired that it might rule the body; the ſimple head was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but what became of it when the tayle tooke the guiding of the head and the reſt of the body? it pulled the head and the body, through the brambles and briars, and had almoſt ſpoyled the whole body. So let us remember that apologue of the bramble, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9. When it got the ruling of the trees of the field, what became of them, a fire came out from it and burnt them.</p>
               <p>In ſome caſe the Lord hath granted as great power to the woman over the man, as he hath granted to the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:173315:148"/>man over the woman, as in the mutuall uſe of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: and in this caſe he is as well ſubject to his wife, as he is her Lord: but in other things the man hath theſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie over the woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Seeing the woman hath as great right over the body of the man, as the man hath over her body, how is it that <hi>Rachel</hi> with her mandrakes perſwaded her husband to lye with her? <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.15. It might ſeeme ſhee had not ſuch a right to claime this of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this polygamie, there was ſome cauſe of exception, becauſe a man had two wives at once, and that of Chriſt may be fitly applied here, <hi>One man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerve two maſters, Mat.</hi> 6.24.</p>
               <p>God made the woman of the rib of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She was not made of the eye as the Hebrewes ſay,

Neither was ſhe made of the eare, that ſhe ſhould not be <hi>auſcultatrix</hi> a hearkener like <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 18.10.14. he made her not of the foot, that ſhee ſhould not be troden upon like the Serpent: But hee made her of the rib, that ſhe might be his collaterall, <hi>to eate of his morſels, drinke of his cup, and ſleepe in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,</hi> 2 <hi>Samuel,</hi> 12.3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> When God tooke this rib out of <hi>Adams</hi> ſide, whether had <hi>Adam</hi> a rib moe than enough; or when it was taken out whether wanted he a rib? To ſay that he wanted a rib, would imply an imperfection; to ſay that he had a rib moe than enough, would imply ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie in <hi>Adam;</hi> which in the eſtate of innocencie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be granted.
<note place="margin">Nonut individuum ſed ut ſpecies.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Adam</hi> muſt not bee conſidered as other men, but as he who repreſented whole mankind; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for he having a rib moe then other men have, who are but ſingular men, yet he had not a rib moe than enough.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:173315:148"/>The ſeed which is in the body of man, is no ſuperfluitie in man, becauſe it ſerveth for the continuation of his kinde; So this rib was no ſuperfluous thing in <hi>Adam,</hi> although he had a rib more than the reſt of mankinde. We count it now a ſuperfluous thing, when a man hath moe fingers than ten, ſo to have moe ribs than twenty-foure.</p>
               <p>Againe, if we ſay it was one of his ordinary ribs, it will not follow, that there was any defect, when this rib was taken out: for wee may ſafely hold, that God put in a new rib in place of it: for when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, that God ſhut up the fleſh in place of it, it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that he cloſed it up onely with fleſh, but alſo with a rib, as <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe afterward ſhewed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2, 23. <hi>ſhe is fleſh of my fleſh, and bone of my bones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how could ſo little a matter as a bone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the whole body of a woman, was this the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or rarifying of the bone, as wee ſee yee rarified into water: or was it by adding new matter to the bone?</p>

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Secunda ſecundae an.</hi> 3.</note> that this could not be by rarification of the bone, for then the body of <hi>Evah</hi> ſhould not have beene ſolid enough, but it was as he holds, by additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of new matter. As the five loaves which fed ſo many thouſands in the wilderneſſe. <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.17. was not by rarifying and extending them, but onely by adding to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whethere was the matter which was added to the rib, firſt turned into a rib, and then made a woman, or was ſhe immediately made a woman of this rib, and the matter added to the rib?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It ſeemeth more probable, that the womans body was made of this matter and the rib, without any new converſion of this matter into a rib; neither need wee to grant two converſions or changes. Therefore
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:173315:149"/>the <hi>ſchoolemen</hi> ſay well, <hi>non ſunt multiplicanda miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la:</hi> it is not probable, that all this matter was changed into a rib, and then it grew up into a body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why is ſhe then rather ſayd to be made of the rib, then of the matter added to the rib?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe principally and chiefly, God choſe that rib, to make the woman of it, and then hee added the reſt of the matter: although there was much more added to the fiue loaves (which fed the people in the wilderneſſe) than the ſubſtance of the five loaves; yet they are ſayd to bee filled with the five loaves, becauſe God tooke them firſt &amp; chiefely for this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, by adding the reſt of the ſubſtance miraculouſly for feeding of the people.</p>
               <p>But wee muſt marke here a difference, betwixt that which was added to the five loaves, and this which was added to the rib of the man; for in that which was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly added to the loaves, there was not a third thing made up of them: but of this rib and the matter added to it,

They hold moreover, that a man once being marryed, if his Wife dye, him they ſeclude not from the Prieſthood: but if a man marry a woman that hath beene marryed before, him they ſeclude from the Prieſthood. So if hee have marryed a divorced woman him they count <hi>digamos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all theſe grounds they have drawne from the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall Law: for the high Prieſt vnder the Law, might not marry a widow, a whore; nor a divorced woman: he might not marry a widow, becauſe he got

               <p>So from the ceremoniall Law they have ordained, that none who hath any blemiſh in his body may be a Prieſt; ſuch they make irregular, and not capable of the Prieſthood.</p>
               <p>So they make <hi>defectus natalitium</hi> an irregularity, that no baſtard can be a Prieſt, all borrowed from the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall law.</p>

               <p>To prove that <hi>Polygamie</hi> is unlawfull, wee will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it by two places of Scripture:
<note place="margin">That Polygamy is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</note> the firſt is out of <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Yee ſhall not take a woman to her ſiſter:</hi> that is, yee ſhall not take moe at once. That this verſe is meant of <hi>monogamie</hi> is proved by analogie with the 16. verſe, where it is ſaid, <hi>thou ſhalt not uncover the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thy ſiſter in Law.</hi> Againe, the text would be too farre ſtrained if it were other wiſe interpreted, for the Scripture calls ſecond wives in <hi>polygamie, vexers</hi> or
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:173315:151"/>
                  <hi>enviers</hi> as here: and the Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Penninah</hi> is called the adverſary of <hi>Anna,</hi> the other wife of <hi>Elka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.6. So <hi>Adah</hi> and <hi>Zillah,</hi> the wives of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech. Gen.</hi> 4.23. Thirdly, becauſe <hi>digamie</hi> and <hi>poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy</hi> ſhould no wayes be diſcharged in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures if not here except to the King, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.16. which were contrary to the Scriptures: and this Chriſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth manifeſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.5. and <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Karram</hi> among the Iewes, called by the Greekes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (theſe followed the literall ſenſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and therefore were called <hi>Domini verſuum:</hi>) they followed this interpretation. But the <hi>Phariſees</hi> (in Chriſts time) interpreted the words thus, <hi>Yee ſhall not take a wife and her ſiſter, ſo long as ſhe liveth:</hi> but after ſhee is dead ye may marry her ſiſter, for (ſay they) as two brethren may marry one wife, <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> 25.5. ſo may one man marry two ſiſters, one ſucceſſively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another.</p>
               <p>But this was onely a phariſaicall gloſſe contrary to the command of God: for when the Lord comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one brother to raiſe up ſeed to another, that was onely to his eldeſt brother, and therefore that place of <hi>Deuteronomy, If brethren dwel together, and one of them want ſeed:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Vnus</hi> is to be underſtood, <hi>Primus</hi> or <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenitus,</hi> for none of the brethren had this priviledge but the eldeſt brother, he was a type of Chriſt, <hi>that was the firſt borne among many brethren, Rom.</hi> 8.29. If ſeed had beene raiſed up to any of the reſt of the brethren, it had bin inceſt, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>The ſecond place to prove that <hi>polygamy</hi> is unlawfull, is out of <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> 17.17. <hi>The King ſhall not multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply wives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Phariſees</hi> who gave way to the ſinnes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, interpreted the Law thus: <hi>The King ſhall not multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply wives;</hi> that is, <hi>he ſhall not have too many wives;</hi> for
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:173315:151"/>they ſay <hi>David</hi> had eight wives, and yet this was no <hi>polygamy</hi> in him; they adde further, that it was lawfull for the King to have eighteene wives, as witneſſeth R. <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Lyra.</hi> But they ſay <hi>Salomon</hi> trangreſſed this commandement, in multyplying wives.</p>
               <p>In this ſame place of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> it is ſaid: <hi>the King ſhall not multiply gold and ſilver.</hi> Now ſay they, as the King might exceed other men in riches: why then was it ſimply diſcharged him to have many wives?</p>
               <p>To this wee anſwere, that when the Lord makes his covenant, it binds him equally, <hi>Who ſits upon the Throne, and him who drawes the water, or hewes the wood, Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> 29.11. The King hath greater priviledges, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and dignities then other men have: but hee hath not greater power to ſinne, for hee is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to multiply gold and ſilver: and that is, to ſeeke for more than may ſerve for his dignity and place: but hee might never multiply wives more then others: for the Law ſtands immoveable, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2, <hi>And they two ſhall be one fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But the Lord ſaid to <hi>David, I have given thy maſters wives into thy boſome,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.8. Therefore a man might marry moe wives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> God gives things two manner of wayes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he gives them by a genrall diſpenſation and gift: and by this gift a man hath not a right to the thing, unleſſe hee get it confirmed by another right: and the things which God permits in this ſenſe,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dona a Deo dupliciter dantur.</hi> 1. <hi>generaliter, &amp; permiſsivè.</hi> 2. <hi>exbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne placito.</hi>
                  </note> may bee ſayd to bee. his gifts. As hee gave <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> power over the Nations: but by this gift <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had no right, for God onely permitted him to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over them. But when God confirmes this firſt gift to a man: then he gives it <hi>ex bene placito</hi> according to his good pleaſure, as he gave <hi>Eva</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:173315:152"/>
               <p>God gave <hi>Sauls</hi> wives to <hi>David</hi> by the firſt gift, onely by permiſſion: but he had never this gift confirmed, therefore no <hi>polygamie</hi> is lawfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what ſhall wee thinke of this <hi>polygamie</hi> of the fathers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Adulterium propriè et largè ſumptum.</note> Wee cannot hold it to bee adultery, taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery properly: for if it had beene adultery in the proper ſignification: God who reproved <hi>David</hi> for his adultery ſo often, would not have ſuffered this ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproved: but our Divines make it a ſinne leſſe than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, and more than fornication.</p>
               <p>Yet taking adultery largely, it may be called adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 9.16. <hi>They ſhall commit adultery and ſhall, not increaſe:</hi> this ſeemes to be ſpoken of the <hi>polygamiſts,</hi> and not of the adulterers: for it were no puniſhment for. the adulterer to want children: but the <hi>Polygamiſts</hi> did chuſe many wives of ſet purpoſe, that they might multiply children. So that <hi>polygamy</hi> in the largeſt ſenſe, may be called adultery. Inceſt is ſometimes called for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5. The leſſe ſinne is there put for the greater ſinne: ſo when <hi>polygamie</hi> is called adultery in the Scriptures, the more ſin is put for the leſſe, yet it is not properly adultery, becauſe God permitted it for the time, that his Church might increaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how came it that the Prophets did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this ſinne?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is in a Countrey a fourfold ſin: the firſt is called <hi>vitium perſonae,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Quadruplex vitium; perſonae, gentis; vocatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, &amp; ſaeculi.</note> the ſinne of the perſon, that they reprooved, which was the ſin of a particular man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>vitium gentis,</hi> the ſinne of a whole nation that ſin they reprooved: as the Prophets reproved the Iewes for their ſtiffeneckedneſſe and hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ther is <hi>vitium vocationis,</hi> the ſin of a mans cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as <hi>Rahab</hi> is called a <hi>Taverner</hi> by <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 2.1. But <hi>Iames</hi> calls her a <hi>Harlot, Iames</hi> 2.25. This ſin they reproved.</p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:173315:152"/>
               <p>Fourthly, there is <hi>vitium ſaeculi,</hi> when the ſinne over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreds all, &amp; is univerſally received as <hi>polygamy</hi> among the Iewes: and this ye ſhall find the prophets ſeldome to have reproved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether had the Iewes any diſpenſation of God in this their <hi>polygamie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some hold that God gave them a diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and to prove this, firſt they ſay that ſome Lawes are <hi>ſtable,</hi> as the ordinances of the Church,
<note place="margin">Lex ſancta, vel eſt ſlabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, immobilis, velincom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutobilis,</note> which every man may not alter. Secondly, ſome lawes are <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable,</hi> as the Lawes given by God himſelfe in his ſecond Table, cannot be diſpenſed with, but by God himſelfe who gave them. Thirdly, ſome Lawes are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commutable,</hi> which cannot be changed by God himſelf, without a ſtaine of his holineſſe.</p>
               <p>They ſay, that theſe lawes of the ſecond table which God had made, flow not neceſſarily from him, as his juſtice and holineſſe doe, but freely: for theſe he wills, or not wills, without any ſtaine of his holineſſe. As for example: <hi>God is to be loved,</hi> therefore <hi>a man may not mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry his brothers wife,</hi> this doth not follow neceſſarily in the ſtricteſt ſignification: but the precepts of the firſt table cannot bee diſpenſed with by God, without a ſtaine of his holineſſe. As for example <hi>God is to be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> therfore, <hi>he cannot diſpence that one ſhould hate him: ſine intrinſeca repugnantia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſay, that God diſpenſed with the fathers in <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamy,</hi> becauſe God is aboue the Law, which is given betwixt creature and creature, which in that reſpect is immoveable, although God himſelfe may change it. But hee is not aboue the eternall law: becauſe hee is not above himſelfe; therefore hee cannot diſpence with that law which is repugnant to his eternity and glory; and theſe are the precepts of the firſt table. But ſeeing <hi>polygamy</hi> is in the ſecond table, God might
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:173315:153"/>diſpence with it, without any ſtaine of his holineſſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, when it is demanded of theſe men, what ſcripture they can bring for this diſpenſation: They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that God himſelfe ſaith to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 21. <hi>Hearken vnto Sarah, in whatſoever ſhe ſaith to thee:</hi> by this admonition, <hi>Abraham</hi> was mooved to caſt out <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> and her ſonne: although this might have ſeemed contrary to the law of nature, therefore the Text ſaith, <hi>this ſeemed hard to Abraham.</hi> So when God ſaith to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Hearken vnto Sarah, in whatſoever ſhee ſaith to thee:</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> bade him take his owne hand-maide, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.1. then <hi>Sarah</hi> was Gods mouth to him in that point alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe words, <hi>Hearken unto Sarah in all that ſhe ſaith;</hi> are not to bee vnderſtood in whatſoever ſhee ſaith; but in all that ſhee ſaith concerning <hi>Hagar</hi> and her ſonne, in that he was to hearken to her. Againe, <hi>Abraham</hi> tooke <hi>Hagar</hi> before he got this direction for to hearken to <hi>Sarah:</hi> ſo that this place can be no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for a diſpenſation to the Patriarchs in their poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy. it was onely a permiſſion which God yeelded unto for the time, as hee granted them a bill of divorce for the hardneſſe of their hearts! but God cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with any of his lawes, neither in the firſt nor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Tables, they are ſo neere joyned together, that thoſe which breake the one, doe breake the other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why did not God puniſh this ſinne in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> God doth three things concerning ſin. Firſt he <hi>pardons</hi> ſinne: ſecondly, he <hi>puniſheth</hi> ſinne, thirdly, he <hi>paſſeth</hi> by ſinne,
<note place="margin">Triafacit Deus peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus, remittit peccatum, punit peccatum, &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terit peccatum.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. <hi>By the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, that paſſed by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſinne <hi>actually forgiven,</hi> and a ſinne <hi>paſſed by,</hi> differ. A ſinne is actually pardoned in the elect comming to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:173315:153"/>knowledge, when they have remorſe for their ſinne; and finde the benefit of the pardon of the ſinne in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. But God paſſeth by a ſinne, when the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in particular knoweth not this ſinne to bee a ſinne which hee commits; and yet the remiſſion of this ſinne is concluded within the remiſſion of the reſt of their ſinnes. The fathers when they got a remiſſion of the reſt of their ſinnes in the bloud of Chriſt, they got alſo the remiſſion of the ſinne of <hi>polygamie,</hi> which was their ſinne of ignorance; and therefore they were to offer a ſacrifice for the ſinnes of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4.15.17. and among the reſt for this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How differed concubines then from other wives? Firſt, they were not ſolemnly married as the other wives, neither was there any ſolemne contract betwixt them as betwixt the man and the wife; they had not dowrie; their ſonnes did not inherit; yet when they were married, the Scripture cals them <hi>wives; Iudg.</hi> 19.1, 2, after that <hi>Abſolon knew Davids</hi> concubines, 2 <hi>Samuel</hi> 16. <hi>David ſhut them up, and hee knew them no more, but he cloſed them up to the day of their death, and they lived in widowhood;</hi> whence <hi>Lyra</hi> gathereth well, that theſe concubines were wives.</p>
               <p>Againe, to prove that <hi>polygamie</hi> is ſinne, and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, it is confirmed by Chriſts words; when hee redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced marriage to the firſt inſtitution againe, <hi>Math.</hi> 19. <hi>Whoſoever puts away his wife, and marrieth another, commits whoredome,</hi> much more he who keepes his wife, and takes another to her, commits whoredome. The Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. gives the like authority to the wife o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the husband, as he giveth to the man over the wife: as it was never lawfull for the wife to have moe huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands at once, therefore it was not lawfull for a man from the beginning, to have moe wives at once.</p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:173315:154"/>

               <p>Secondly, they muſt be alike in degrees, there would not be too great inequalitie betwixt the perſons who marry: but ſome make the inequalitie in their owne eſtimation, where theee is none at all.</p>
               <p>That apologue in the 2 <hi>King</hi> 14.9. ſheweth this well. The Thiſtle of Lebanon ſent to the Cedar of Lebanon to make a mariage with it, but the beaſts of the field treade downe the Thiſtle But there was not ſo great oddes betwixt the ten tribes and the two tribes as betwixt the baſe Thiſtle, and the tall Cedar of Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non: this came onely from the high conceit which they had of themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Iewes have another apologue, very fit for this purpoſe. They ſay that the Moon upon a time ſought to marry with the Sunne, the Sun ſaid that the Moon could be no match to him; for he ruled the day and the yeare, hee nouriſhed all things with his heate, hee
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:173315:155"/>ruled the heart of man, the moſt excellent part of the body, and by his heate hee breedes the gold, the moſt excellent of the metals. But the Moone replied, that there was not ſo great oddes; for if the Sunne ruled the day, She ruled the night; if the Sunne ruled the yeare, ſhe ruled the moneths: if hee nouriſhed things with his heate, yet hee ſcorched and burned many of them: and if it were not for the moyſture which they receive of her in the night, they would quickly periſh; if he ruled the heart of man, ſhe rules the braine of man; if he breed the gold, ſhee breedes the ſilver: therefore there is not ſo great oddes betwixt the Sunne and the Moone, but they may marry together.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3. <hi>In aetate.</hi>
                  </note> the man and the woman muſt bee like in age. The mother of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the tyrant, being very old, deſired her ſonne to cauſe a young man to marry her: he anſwered; <hi>I can doe any thing, but I cannot inforce nature: Naomi</hi> ſaid, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1. <hi>I am too old to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Spartanes,</hi> there was a ſet time for their marriage: and they had <hi>poenam</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> upon theſe who had deferred their marriage too long: their puniſhment was, that they were never ſuffered to marry. Where theſe three reſpects before mentioned (to wit, religion, degrees, and age) are not obſerved in marriage; often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the conjunction of them, is like the coupling of <hi>Sampſons</hi> foxe-tayles, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 15. which had a fire-brand bound betwixt every of them; ſo theſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally yoaked, the firebrand of Gods wrath falls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them ſometimes.</p>

               <p>It is good for man not to be alone,

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Illuſt. </seg>
                  </label> for the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankinde: but it is good for man to be alone, in reſpect of that, <hi>quod bonum utile vocamus,</hi> that is, when
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:173315:155"/>hee hath the gift of God to abſtaine, for the kingdome of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. that hee may the more exerciſe himſelfe in theſe holy duties of prayer, and other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious exerciſes.</p>
               <p>Here we muſt marke, that there is a twofold good;
<note place="margin">Duplex bonum; expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiae, &amp; morale.</note> to wit, the <hi>good of expediencie,</hi> and <hi>morall good. Morall good</hi> is oppoſite to ſinne, but not <hi>expedient good.</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>it is not good to marry,</hi> his meaning is, that it is not expedient good at that time to marry, not that hee would make it a ſinne; for he ſaith alſo, if he marry, he ſinnes not.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of circumſtances, at that time it was better not to marry, this is onely <hi>bonum ſecundum quid,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively good in reſpect of the perſecutions that were that time riſen in the Church under the perſecuting Emperours.</p>

                  <hi>Virginity</hi> is not a vertue of it ſelfe,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Prop. </seg>
                  </label> and no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable before God, than <hi>marriage</hi> is.
<note place="margin">That Virginity is not a vertue, and therefore not to be vowed.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This is proved by two reaſons: the firſt is, that all vertues by repentance may bee reſtored to man.
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> But virginity cannot be reſtored by repentance, therefore virginity is not a vertue.</p>
               <p>All vertues in time and place are commanded,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> but virginity is left free, and onely <hi>Paul</hi> gives his adviſe in it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. Therefore it is not a vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gerſon</hi> uſeth a third reaſon thus,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> All vertues are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexae,</hi> coupled together; and he who hath one of them is capable of them all; but married folkes who have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues, are not capable of irginity; therefore vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity is not a vertue.</p>
               <p>But this reaſon holds not,
<note place="margin">Virtutes; vel ſunt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectae, vel imperfectae.</note> becauſe all vertues are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together that are perfect vertues: but theſe that are imperfect vertues, are not alwayes coupled together. The perfect vertues are <hi>prudency, temperancy, fortitude</hi> and <hi>juſtice,</hi> he that hath one of theſe hath all the reſt,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:173315:156"/>but a man may have one of the inferiour vertues, and not have the reſt, as the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> had <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and ſuffered many things for Chriſt, <hi>yet ſhe fell from her firſt love, Revel.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7. <hi>The unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried pleaſeth the Lord,</hi> therefore Virginitie is a vertue.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Dupliciter placemus Deo; in Chriſto, &amp; in officio: ſeu cauſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; conſequenter.</note> We pleaſe God two wayes; firſt, onely by his Sonne <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the cauſe; ſecondly, we pleaſe God in that <hi>calling,</hi> that God hath called us to; if wee have the gift of continency, then we pleaſe him in the unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried life; if we have not the gift, then we pleaſe him in marriage, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Women ſhall be ſaved through hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of children;</hi> that is, they pleaſe God, when they are called to that eſtate, to live in wedlocke, and to bring up their children in his feare; then they teſtifie that they are in Chriſt; ſo that we pleaſe God as well in the one eſtate as in the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſeeing Virginity is not a vertue, what will yee make it then?</p>

So <hi>virginitie</hi> is not a thing that is <hi>good</hi> in it ſelfe, but <hi>good</hi> for another end, that is, when a man lives a ſingle life, having the gift of Chaſtitie, that hee may be the more fit to ſerve God.</p>
               <p>Virginity is no more acceptable before God than marriage; therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> preferring <hi>virginitie</hi> ſo farre above <hi>marriage,</hi> is ſtrangely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded: for they gloſſing that parable of the ſower, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. ſay that <hi>Virginitie</hi> bringeth out a hudred fold; <hi>Widowhood</hi> ſixtie fold; and <hi>mariage,</hi> but thirty fold.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, they ſay, that there are three crownes;
